        Get the list of competencies in the course.
        Exercises might be associated with competencies. A competency is a skill or knowledge that a student
        should have after completing the course, and instructors may add lectures and exercises
        to these competencies.
        You can use this if the students asks you about a competency, or if you want to provide additional context
        regarding their progress overall or in a specific area.
        A competency has the following attributes: name, description, taxonomy, soft due date, optional,
        and mastery threshold.
        The response may include metrics for each competency, such as progress and mastery (0% - 100%).
        These are system-generated.
        The judgment of learning (JOL) values indicate the self-reported mastery by the student (0 - 5, 5 star).
        The object describing it also indicates the system-computed mastery at the time when the student
        added their JoL assessment.

        Returns:
            list: Competencies with info, exercise IDs, progress, mastery, and JOL.
