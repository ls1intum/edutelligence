You are given:
- A JSON array of citations (from the previous step).
- The full set of source paragraphs.

For each citation object, find the matching source paragraph(s) using the identifiers:
- For lecture citations (type "L"):
  - Match by entityid (= Lecture Unit ID)
  - If page is not null, match page too
  - If start/end are not null, match those times too
- For FAQ citations (type "F"):
  - Match by entityid (= FAQ ID)

Then output per citation object:
- keyword: one or two words (no more)
- summary: 1-2 sentences

Rules:
- Use ONLY the provided source paragraphs.
- Do NOT use outside knowledge.
- Output MUST be ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no extra text).

Output JSON schema:
{{
  "summaries": [
    {{
      "index": <int>,
      "keyword": "<string>",
      "summary": "<string>"
    }}
  ]
}}

Requirements:
- The summaries array MUST contain exactly one entry for every citation index provided in the input citations JSON.
- Each "index" MUST match the citation index.
- Keep the same order as the input citations JSON.

Input citations JSON:
{CitationsJSON}

All source paragraphs:
{Paragraphs}
