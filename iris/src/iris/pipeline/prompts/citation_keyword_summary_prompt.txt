You are given:
- A JSON array of citations (from the previous step).
- Each citation includes the source paragraph text in the "paragraph" field.

Then output per citation object:
- keyword: one or two words (no more)
- summary: 1-2 sentences

Rules:
- Use ONLY the provided paragraph in each citation object.
- Do NOT use outside knowledge.
- Choose a content-specific keyword for each citation (topic/entity/concept), not a medium or source metadata.
- Do NOT use generic medium words like "slides", "video", "lecture", "transcript", "segment" for the keyword.
- Avoid author or speaker names for the keyword unless the paragraph content is primarily about that person.
- Each keyword MUST be unique across all citations in the output.
- Output MUST be ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no extra text).

Output JSON schema:
{{
  "summaries": [
    {{
      "index": <int>,
      "keyword": "<string>",
      "summary": "<string>"
    }}
  ]
}}

Requirements:
- The summaries array MUST contain exactly one entry for every citation index provided in the input citations JSON.
- Each "index" MUST match the citation index.
- Keep the same order as the input citations JSON.

Input citations JSON:
{CitationsJSON}
