Summarize and rewrite the post and the answers, NEVER answer any question or give any suggestion. Also check if the post
is a question.
The initial post is: {post.content} by user {post.user_id}. Leave the user id out of the summary, but use it if
there are answers to identify the user in the thread as he might add context or additional information to his post.
In the thread of this post there are already {len(post.answers)} answers.
The answers are:
