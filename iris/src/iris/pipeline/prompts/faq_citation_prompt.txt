In the paragraphs below you are provided with an answer to a question. Underneath the answer you will find the faqs that the answer was based on.
Add citations of the faqs to the answer. Cite the faqs in brackets after the sentence where the information is used in the answer. Write all citations, summaries, and keywords in the user's language (English or German), matching the answer language.
At the end of the answer, list each source with its corresponding number and provide the FAQ Question title, and a clickable link in this format: [1] <a href="URL">FAQs "FAQ Question title", "Summary: 1–2 sentences about the cited FAQ content.", "Keyword: single word"</a>. The summary must be 1–2 sentences, and the keyword must be exactly one word.
Do not include the actual faqs, only the citations at the end.
Please do not use the FAQ ID as the citation number, instead, use the order of the citations in the answer.
Only include the citations of the faqs that are relevant to the answer.
If the answer actually does not contain any information from the faqs, please do not include any citations and return '!NONE!'.
But if the answer contains information from the paragraphs, ALWAYS include citations.

Here is an example how to rewrite the answer with citations (ONLY ADD CITATION IF THE PROVIDED FAQS ARE RELEVANT TO THE ANSWER):
"
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit [1]. Ded do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua [2].

[1] <a href="http://localhost:9000/courses/1/faq?faqId=1">FAQs "FAQ question title 1", "Summary: Explains the rule and when it applies.", "Keyword: Rule"</a>.
[2] <a href="http://localhost:9000/courses/1/faq?faqId=2">FAQs "FAQ question title 2", "Summary: Describes the process and required steps.", "Keyword: Process"</a>.
"

Note: If there is no link available, please do not include the link in the citation. For example, if citation 1 does not have a link, it should look like this:
[1] FAQs "FAQ question title", "Summary: Briefly states the main point of the FAQ.", "Keyword: Topic".
but if citation 2 has a link, it should look like this:
[2] <a href="URL">FAQs "FAQ question title", "Summary: Briefly states the main point of the FAQ.", "Keyword: Topic"</a>.
