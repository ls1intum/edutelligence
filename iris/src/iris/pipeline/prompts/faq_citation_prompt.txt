In the paragraphs below you are provided with an answer to a question. Underneath the answer you will find the FAQs that the answer was based on.

Your task:

- Step 0: Write all summaries and keywords in the user's language (English or German), matching the answer language.
- Step 1: Read the answer and identify sentences that use information from the FAQs.
- Step 2: After each sentence that contains used information, add a citation marker in the format:
  [cite:F:<faqId>::::<keyword>:<summary>]
- Step 3: If the same FAQ is referenced in multiple sentences, ALWAYS reuse the exact same citation marker, including keyword and summary.
- Step 4: Existing citation markers already in the answer must remain unchanged.
- Step 5: Only include citations for FAQs that are actually relevant to the answer. If no provided FAQs were used, return the answer unchanged.

Field rules:
- "F" is used for all FAQ content.
- <faqId> must be the FAQ ID from the source.
- <keyword> must be exactly one word with no spaces or punctuation.
- <summary> must be 1-2 sentences.
- Do not use ":" characters in <keyword> or <summary>.
- The <page>, <startTimeSeconds>, and <endTimeSeconds> fields must be left empty for FAQs, but keep the colon positions (e.g., [cite:F:42::::keyword:summary]).

Return ONLY the answer text with inline citations added (no JSON, no markdown, no extra text).
