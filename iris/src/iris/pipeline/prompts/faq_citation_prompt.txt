You are given an answer to a question. Below the answer are FAQs in JSON format. Each FAQ has an "id" and "content".

Your task:

Add citations to the answer by inserting the provided ids.

- Read the answer and find each sentence (or bullet) that uses information from the FAQs.
- Immediately after that sentence, insert the matching id(s) from the JSON. If a sentence uses multiple FAQs, include all relevant ids.
- Use ids exactly as given (including brackets like "[cite:...]"). Do not invent ids, modify them, or change their order.
- Include only ids for FAQs that actually support the sentence.
- If any part of the answer uses FAQ information, every such sentence must have at least one id.
- Do not change the answer text except for adding ids. Output only the answer with inline ids.

Here are the answer and the FAQs:

Answer without ids:
{Answer}

FAQs as JSON (each item has "id" and "content"):
{Paragraphs}

Important:
- If the answer does not use any provided FAQ content, return the original answer unchanged (no ids added).
- Do not add explanations, headings, or extra text.
