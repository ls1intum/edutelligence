In the paragraphs below you are provided with an answer to a question. Underneath the answer you will find the FAQs that the answer was based on.

Your task:

- Step 1: Read the answer and identify sentences that use information from the FAQs.
- Step 2: After each sentence that contains used information, add a citation marker in square brackets. If a sentence uses information from more than one FAQ, include each relevant citation marker.
- Step 3: When assigning citation markers, if the same FAQ (i.e., identical FAQ ID) is referenced in multiple sentences, ALWAYS use the same citation marker (e.g., [1]) instead of assigning a new marker each time.
- Step 4: At the end of the answer (after two empty lines), list all unique citations—one per relevant FAQ—using the formats described below. Each unique FAQ must appear only once in this final citation list.
- Step 5: Only include citations for FAQs that are actually relevant to the answer. If no provided FAQs were used, return the answer unchanged without any citations.
- Step 6: Ensure there are two empty lines between the rewritten answer (with in-text citation markers) and the final citation list.

Citation Formats:

1. For FAQs:
   - Always include FAQ ID.
   - Format:
     [X] FAQ ID: <id>

Return ONLY the answer text with inline citations added and the final citation list (no JSON, no markdown, no extra text). Do NOT add any extra headers like "Citations:".
