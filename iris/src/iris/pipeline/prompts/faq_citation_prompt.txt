In the paragraphs below you are provided with an answer to a question. Underneath the answer you will find the FAQs that the answer was based on.

Your task:

- Step 0: Write all summaries and keywords in the user's language (English or German), matching the answer language.
- Step 1: Read the answer and identify sentences that use information from the FAQs.
- Step 2: After each sentence that contains used information, add a citation marker in the format [cite:n].
- Step 3: If the same FAQ is referenced in multiple sentences, ALWAYS use the same citation marker (e.g., [cite:1]) instead of assigning a new marker each time.
- Step 4: Existing citation markers already in the answer must remain unchanged. Existing markers: {ExistingCitationMarkers}. When you add NEW markers, start numbering at {StartIndex} and continue sequentially, always using [cite:n].
- Step 5: Return ONLY a JSON object (no markdown, no extra text) with the schema below.
- Step 6: Only include citations for FAQs that are actually relevant to the answer. If no provided FAQs were used, return the answer unchanged with an empty citations list.
- Step 7: Always include citations if the answer contains any information from the provided FAQs.

Output JSON schema:
{
  "answer": "<answer text with citation markers in [cite:n] format>",
  "citations": [
    {

      "link": "https://...",
      "faq_question_title": "...",
      "summary": "1-2 sentences about the cited FAQ content.",
      "keyword": "OneWord"
    }
  ]
}

Field rules:
- "type" must be "faq".
- "index" must match the citation marker number in [cite:n].
- "keyword" must be exactly one word with no spaces or punctuation.
- "summary" must be 1-2 sentences.
