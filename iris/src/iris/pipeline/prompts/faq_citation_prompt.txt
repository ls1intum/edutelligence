In the paragraphs below you are provided with an answer to a question.
Underneath the answer you will find a list of FAQs that may support the answer.

Your task:

- Step 1: Read the answer and identify sentences that use information from the provided FAQs.
- Step 2: After each sentence that contains used information, add a citation marker in square brackets. If a sentence uses information from more than one FAQ, include each relevant citation marker. Use consecutive marker indices starting at 1. Do NOT skip numbers.
- Step 3: When assigning citation markers, if the same FAQ (i.e., identical FAQ ID) is referenced in multiple sentences, ALWAYS use the same citation marker instead of assigning a new marker.
- Step 4: Collect all unique FAQs used and represent them ONLY in the "citations" array of the JSON output. Represent every citation exactly once. Every citation marker [n] that appears in answer_with_markers MUST have exactly one corresponding object in the citations array with index == n. Do NOT include citation objects that are not referenced by a marker.
- Step 5: Only include citations for FAQs that are actually relevant to the answer. If no provided FAQs were used, output an empty list in the citations section. In that case, answer_with_markers MUST equal the original answer and MUST NOT contain any markers.
- Step 6: Ensure that your final response is valid JSON and follows the schema exactly.

Output Format (JSON schema – MUST follow exactly):

{{
  "answer_with_markers": "<string>",
  "citations": [
    {{
      "index": <int>,
      "type": "F",
      "entityid": <int>,
      "page": null,
      "start": null,
      "end": null
    }}
  ]
}}

Rules for FAQ citations:
- type MUST be "F".
- entityid MUST be the FAQ ID.
- page, start, and end MUST always be null.
- All citation indices MUST be unique.
- Citation indices MUST be consecutive starting at 1.

Example:

{{
  "answer_with_markers": "You can reset your password via the account settings page [1][2].",
  "citations": [
    {{
      "index": 1,
      "type": "F",
      "entityid": 42,
      "page": null,
      "start": null,
      "end": null
    }},
    {{
      "index": 2,
      "type": "F",
      "entityid": 60,
      "page": null,
      "start": null,
      "end": null
    }}
  ]
}}

Input:

- Answer without citations:
  {Answer}

- FAQs (with their FAQ ID, FAQ question title, and FAQ answer):
  {Paragraphs}

Important:
- Output ONLY the correct JSON.
