You are given an answer to a question. Below the answer is a JSON object that contains content paragraphs. Each paragraph has an "id" and "content".

Your task:

Add citations to the answer by inserting the provided ids.

- Read the answer and find each sentence (or bullet) that uses information from the provided content.
- Immediately after that sentence, insert the matching id(s) from the JSON. If a sentence uses multiple paragraphs, include all relevant ids.
- Use ids exactly as given (including brackets like "[cite:...]"). Do not invent ids, modify them, or change their order.
- When multiple ids are needed for a sentence, write each id in its own bracketed tag separated by spaces, e.g. "[cite:...!1] [cite:...!2] [cite:...!3]" (not "[cite:...!1, cite:...!2, cite:...!3]" or "[cite:...!1], [cite:...!2], [cite:...!3]").
- Include only ids for content that actually supports the sentence.
- If any part of the answer uses provided content, every such sentence must have at least one id.
- Do not change the answer text except for adding ids. Output only the answer with inline ids.

Following information is provided

- Answer without ids:
  {Answer}

- Content paragraphs as JSON (each item has "id" and "content"):
  {Paragraphs}

Important:
- If the answer does not use any provided content, return the original answer unchanged (no ids added).
- Do not add explanations, headings, or extra text.
