In the paragraphs below you are provided with an answer to a question. Underneath the answer, you will find two sets of source paragraphs:

1. Lecture Slides: Contains information with Lecture Unit IDs and Page Numbers.
2. Lecture Transcriptions: Contains information with Lecture Unit IDs, start times, and end times (HH:MM:SS and seconds).

Your task is to add inline citation markers to the answer for any sentence that uses information from the provided sources.

========================
OUTPUT (VERY IMPORTANT)
========================
- Return ONLY the final answer text with inline citations added.
- Do NOT return JSON.
- Do NOT return a registry, explanation, headings, or any extra text.
- The output must be the answer text only.

========================
LANGUAGE
========================
- Write ALL keywords and summaries in the user's language (English or German), matching the answer language.

========================
WHAT TO CITE
========================
- Identify sentences in the answer that use information from the provided Lecture Slides and/or Lecture Transcriptions.
- After each such sentence, append one or more citation markers.
- If a sentence uses multiple sources, append multiple markers.

========================
EXISTING CITATIONS
========================
- Existing citation markers already in the answer must remain unchanged.
- Do not edit, remove, or renumber existing markers.

========================
SOURCE IDENTITY (STRICT)
========================
To ensure stable reuse of keyword and summary, sources are considered identical ONLY by these keys:

Slides source key:
- (lectureUnitId + page)

Video source key:
- (lectureUnitId + startTimeSeconds + endTimeSeconds)

IMPORTANT:
- For slides, if lectureUnitId and page are the same, it is ALWAYS the SAME SOURCE.
- For videos, if lectureUnitId and startTimeSeconds and endTimeSeconds are the same, it is ALWAYS the SAME SOURCE.

========================
CANONICAL MARKER REUSE (STRICT)
========================
- For EACH unique Slides source key (lectureUnitId + page), you MUST choose exactly ONE keyword and ONE summary.
  You MUST reuse the exact same keyword and the exact same summary (character-for-character) every time you cite that same slide page again.
  You are NOT allowed to create a second variant marker for the same slide page, even if you cite different facts from that page.

- For EACH unique Video source key (lectureUnitId + startTimeSeconds + endTimeSeconds), you MUST choose exactly ONE keyword and ONE summary.
  You MUST reuse them verbatim every time you cite that same video segment again.

- If you are about to cite a source key you have cited earlier, you MUST copy the previously used marker's keyword and summary exactly.
  Do NOT paraphrase, shorten, expand, or change them.

SUMMARY SCOPE REQUIREMENT:
- Because one page/segment may support multiple statements, the summary MUST be a BROAD summary of that page/segment,
  not a micro-step summary (e.g., not only "baking" or only "filling"). Choose a general summary that stays true for repeated citations.

========================
CITATION MARKER FORMAT (EXACT)
========================
After each cited sentence, append a marker in the exact format with EXACTLY 7 colon-separated fields:

[cite:L:<lectureUnitId>:<page>:<startTimeSeconds>:<endTimeSeconds>:<keyword>:<summary>]

Field rules:
- "L" is used for all lecture content (slides or videos).
- <lectureUnitId> must be the Lecture Unit ID from the source.
- <page> is the slide page number if the cited material is a slide; otherwise leave it empty.
- <startTimeSeconds> and <endTimeSeconds> are seconds if the cited material is a video segment; otherwise leave them empty.
- Only fill fields that are actually available. If a field is not available, leave it empty but KEEP the colon position.
  Examples:
  - Slide citation: [cite:L:123:5:::keyword:summary]
  - Video citation: [cite:L:123::120:180:keyword:summary]

NUMERIC FIELD RULES (VERY IMPORTANT):
- <page> must be NUMBERS ONLY (e.g., 28). Never include "p" or any other characters.
- <startTimeSeconds> and <endTimeSeconds> must be NUMBERS ONLY.

KEYWORD RULES:
- <keyword> must be 1–2 words.
- No punctuation, no ":" characters, no newlines.

SUMMARY RULES:
- <summary> must be EXACTLY 1 sentence.
- 12–25 words.
- No ":" characters, no newlines.

COLON SAFETY:
- Never insert extra colons.
- Never remove colons.
- The marker must always have exactly 7 colon-separated fields after "[cite".

========================
RELEVANCE
========================
- Only include citations for paragraphs that are actually relevant to the answer.
- If no provided paragraphs were used, return the answer unchanged.
