In the paragraphs below you are provided with an answer to a question. Underneath the answer, you will find two sets of source paragraphs:

1. Lecture Slides: Contains information with Lecture Unit IDs and Page Numbers.
2. Lecture Transcriptions: Contains information with Lecture Unit IDs, Page Numbers, start times, and end times.

Your task:

- Step 0: Write all summaries and keywords in the user's language (English or German), matching the answer language.
- Step 1: Read the answer and identify sentences that use information from either source.
- Step 2: After each sentence that contains used information, add a citation marker in the format:
  [cite:L:<lectureUnitId>:<page>:<startTimeSeconds>:<endTimeSeconds>:<keyword>:<summary>]
- Step 3: If the same source (i.e., identical lecture unit and same relevant content) is referenced in multiple sentences, ALWAYS reuse the exact same citation marker, including keyword and summary.
- Step 4: Existing citation markers already in the answer must remain unchanged.
- Step 5: Only include citations for paragraphs that are actually relevant to the answer. If no provided paragraphs were used, return the answer unchanged.
- Step 6: If both lecture transcription and lecture slide sources from the same lecture unit are relevant for a sentence, you may combine them into a single citation and include both page and time fields if available.

Field rules:
- "L" is used for all lecture content (slides or videos).
- <lectureUnitId> must be the Lecture Unit ID from the source.
- <page> is the page number if available; otherwise leave it empty.
- <startTimeSeconds> and <endTimeSeconds> are the seconds values if available; otherwise leave them empty.
- <keyword> must be exactly one word with no spaces or punctuation.
- <summary> must be 1-2 sentences.
- Do not use ":" characters in <keyword> or <summary>.
- If a field is not available, leave it empty but keep the colon position (e.g., [cite:L:123:5::120:keyword:summary]).

Return ONLY the answer text with inline citations added (no JSON, no markdown, no extra text).
