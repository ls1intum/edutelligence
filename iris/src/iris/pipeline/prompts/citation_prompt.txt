In the paragraphs below you are provided with an answer to a question. Underneath the answer, you will find two sets of source paragraphs:

1. Lecture Slides: Contains information with Lecture Names, Unit Names, Links, and Page Numbers.
2. Lecture Transcriptions: Contains information with Lecture Names, Unit Names, Links, start times, and end times.

Your task:

- Step 0: Write all citations, summaries, and keywords in the user's language (English or German), matching the answer language.
- Step 1: Read the answer and identify sentences that use information from either source.
- Step 2: After each sentence that contains used information, add a citation marker in square brackets. If a sentence uses information from more than one source, include each relevant citation marker.
- Step 3: When assigning citation markers, if the same source (i.e., identical citation details) is referenced in multiple sentences, ALWAYS use the same citation marker (e.g., [1]) instead of assigning a new marker each time.
- Step 4: At the end of the answer (after two empty lines), list all unique citations—one per relevant source—using the formats described below. Each unique source must appear only once in this final citation list.
- Step 5: Include the summary and keyword only inside each citation line as shown in the citation formats. Do NOT repeat them as separate lines.
- Step 5a: The keyword must be exactly one word with no spaces or punctuation. Do NOT use labels like "Summary:" or "Keyword:" and do NOT use commas, slashes, or multi-word phrases. Example: "Tradition".
- Step 6: Only include citations for paragraphs that are actually relevant to the answer. If no provided paragraphs were used, output !NONE! without any citations.
- Step 7: Always include citations if the answer contains any information from the provided paragraphs.
- Step 8: If both lecture transcription and lecture slide sources are found to be relevant, include citations for both types of sources.
- Step 9: Ensure there are two empty lines between the rewritten answer (with in-text citation markers) and the final citation list.

Citation Formats:

1. For Lecture Transcriptions:
   - Prefix the citation text with a language-dependent label:
     - If English: "Video"
     - If German: "Video"
   - Format with a link available - with the start time stated in the link; if the link contains "?video_only=1" remove it and add the correct timestamp:
     [X] <a href="URL"?t="start time" target="_blank">Video "Lecture title", "Lecture unit title", "1–2 sentences about the cited content.", "Tradition"</a>.
   - ONLY if no link is available, do not include a clickable link; simply output the citation text (e.g., Video "Lecture title", "Lecture unit title"). Then append a 1–2 sentence summary and a single keyword (one word).
   - URL modification for transcriptions: If the URL has a "videoOnly" parameter, remove it. If you know the start time, add it to the URL as a query parameter in the format `?t=ss`, where `ss` is the start time in seconds.
   - You are given the time in HH:MM:SS AND in seconds. Use the seconds value for the URL; use the HH:MM:SS format for the citation text.
   - If you use this format with start and end times, ALWAYS link to the transcription with the start time included, not to the slides.


2. For Lecture Slides:
   - Prefix the citation text with a language-dependent label:
     - If English: "Slides"
     - If German: "Vorlesungsfolien"
   - When you see "Slides" in the formats below, replace it with "Vorlesungsfolien" for German output.
   - Format with a link available:
     [X] <a href="URL" target="_blank">Slides "Lecture title", "Lecture unit title", "1–2 sentences about the cited content.", "Tradition"</a>.
   - If no link is available, output the citation without a clickable link, e.g.,
     [X] Slides "Lecture title", "Lecture unit title", "1–2 sentences about the cited content.", "Tradition"
   - If you use this format without transcription times, ALWAYS link to the slides (usually a PDF) and not to the transcription.

Example:

If the answer is:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit [1]. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua [1][2].

Then the citation list at the answer end might be:
[1] <a href="https://example.com/1234?t=12">Video "Lecture title", "Lecture unit title", "Explains the key concept introduced at that timestamp and the main takeaway.", "Concept"</a>.
[2] <a href="https://example.com/1234?t=17">Slides "Lecture Title", "Unit Title", "Covers the definition and a brief example shown on the slide.", "Definition"</a>.

Below the answer, the following information is provided:

- Answer without citations:
  {Answer}

- Paragraphs with their Lecture Names, Unit Names, Links and Page Numbers for lecture slides:
  {Paragraphs}

- Paragraphs with their Lecture Names, Unit Names, Page Numbers, Links, start times and end times for lecture transcriptions:
  {TranscriptionParagraphs}

Important:
- If the answer does not contain any information from the provided paragraphs or if there are no paragraphs, output !NONE! without any citations.
- Ensure there are two empty lines between the rewritten answer (with in-text citations) and the citation list at the end.
