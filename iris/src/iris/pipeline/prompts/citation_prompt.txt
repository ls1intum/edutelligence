In the paragraphs below you are provided with an answer to a question. Underneath the answer, you will find two sets of source paragraphs:

1. Lecture Slides: Contains information with Lecture Names, Unit Names, Links, and Page Numbers.
2. Lecture Transcriptions: Contains information with Lecture Names, Unit Names, Page Numbers, Links, start times, and end times.

Your task:

- Step 1: Read the answer and identify sentences that use information from either source.
- Step 2: After each sentence that contains used information, add a citation marker in square brackets. If a sentence uses information from more than one source, include each relevant citation marker.
- Step 3: When assigning citation markers, if the same source (i.e., identical citation details) is referenced in multiple sentences, ALWAYS use the same citation marker (e.g., [1]) instead of assigning a new marker each time.
- Step 4: At the end of the answer (after two empty lines), list all unique citations—one per relevant source—using the formats described below. Each unique source must appear only once in this final citation list.
- Step 5: Only include citations for paragraphs that are actually relevant to the answer. If no provided paragraphs were used, output !NONE! without any citations.
- Step 6: Always include citations if the answer contains any information from the provided paragraphs.
- Step 7: If both lecture transcription and lecture slide sources are found to be relevant, include citations for both types of sources.
- Step 8: Ensure there are two empty lines between the rewritten answer (with in-text citation markers) and the final citation list.

Citation Formats:

1. For Lecture Transcriptions:
   - Format with a link available:
     [X] <a href="URL">"Lecture title", "Lecture unit title", page number, start time, end time</a>.
   - If no link is available, do not include a clickable link; simply output the citation text (e.g., "Lecture title", "Lecture unit title", "page number", start time, end time). Start and end times should be displayed in the format hh:mm:ss.
   - **Important:** Ensure that a start time and an end time are always displayed for lecture transcriptions, regardless of link availability.

2. For Lecture Slides:
   - Format with a link available:
     [X] <a href="URL">Lecture title, Lecture unit title, page number(s)</a>.
   - If no link is available, output the citation without a clickable link, e.g.,
     [X] "Lecture title", "Lecture unit title", "page number(s)".

Example:

If the answer is:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit [1]. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua [1][2].

Then the citation list at the answer end might be:
[1] <a href="https://example.com/1234?t=12">Slide 6, start at 00:00:12, end at 00:00:15</a>.
[2] <a href="https://example.com/1234?t=17">Lecture Title, Unit Title, page 7</a>.

Below the answer, the following information is provided:

- Answer without citations:
  {Answer}

- Paragraphs with their Lecture Names, Unit Names, Links and Page Numbers for lecture slides:
  {Paragraphs}

- Paragraphs with their Lecture Names, Unit Names, Page Numbers, Links, start times and end times for lecture transcriptions:
  {TranscriptionParagraphs}

Important:
- If the answer does not contain any information from the provided paragraphs or if there are no paragraphs, output !NONE! without any citations.
- Ensure there are two empty lines between the rewritten answer (with in-text citations) and the citation list at the end.
