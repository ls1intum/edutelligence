In the paragraphs below you are provided with an answer to a question. Underneath the answer, you will find two sets of source paragraphs:

1. Lecture Slides: Contains Lecture Unit ID and Page number plus the content.
2. Lecture Transcriptions: Contains Lecture Unit ID, optional Page number, start and end times in seconds plus the content.

Your task:

- Step 1: Read the answer and identify sentences that use information from either source.
- Step 2: After each sentence that contains used information, add a citation marker in square brackets. If a sentence uses information from more than one source, include each relevant citation marker.
- Step 3: When assigning citation markers, if the same source (i.e., identical citation details) is referenced in multiple sentences, ALWAYS use the same citation marker (e.g., [1]) instead of assigning a new marker each time.
- Step 4: At the end of the answer (after two empty lines), list all unique citations—one per relevant source—using the formats described below. Each unique source must appear only once in this final citation list.
- Step 5: Only include citations for paragraphs that are actually relevant to the answer. If no provided paragraphs were used, output !NONE! without any citations.
- Step 6: Always include citations if the answer contains any information from the provided paragraphs.
- Step 7: If both lecture transcription and lecture slide sources are found to be relevant, include citations for both types of sources.
- Step 8: Ensure there are two empty lines between the rewritten answer (with in-text citation markers) and the final citation list.

Citation Formats:

1. For everything taken from the TranscriptionParagraphs section (Lecture Transcriptions):
   - Always include Lecture Unit ID, Start Time, End Time. Include Page only if available in the source.
   - If a field is not present in the source, leave it empty.
   - Do NOT add any extra prefixes like "Lecture Transcription:" or "Lecture Slides:".
   - Format:
     [X] Lecture Unit ID: <id>, Start: <start time in seconds>, End: <end time in seconds>
     [X] Lecture Unit ID: <id>, Page: <page>, Start: <start time in seconds>, End: <end time in seconds>

2. For everything taken from the Paragraphs section (Lecture Slides):
   - Include Lecture Unit ID and Page ONLY. Do NOT include Start/End.
   - Do NOT add any extra prefixes like "Lecture Slides:".
   - Format:
     [X] Lecture Unit ID: <id>, Page: <page>

Example:

If the answer is:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit [1]. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua [1][2].

Then the citation list at the answer end might be:
[1] Lecture Unit ID: 1234, Page: 6, Start: 12, End: 15
[2] Lecture Unit ID: 5678, Page: 7

Below the answer, the following information is provided:

- Answer without citations:
  {Answer}

- Paragraphs for citing slides (with their Lecture Unit ID and Page numbers for lecture slides):
  {Paragraphs}

- TranscriptionParagraphs for citing transcriptions/videos (with their Lecture Unit ID, Page numbers, and start/end times in seconds for lecture transcriptions):
  {TranscriptionParagraphs}

Important:
- If the answer does not contain any information from the provided paragraphs or if there are no paragraphs, output the unchanged answer without any citations.
- Ensure there are two empty lines between the rewritten answer (with in-text citations) and the citation list at the end.
- Do NOT add any extra headers or labels like "Citations:" or "**Citations:**". Output only the answer text and the citation list.
