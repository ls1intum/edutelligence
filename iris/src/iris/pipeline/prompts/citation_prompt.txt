In the paragraphs below you are provided with an answer to a question. Underneath the answer, you will find two sets of source paragraphs:

1. Lecture Slides: Contains information with Lecture Names, Unit Names, Links, and Page Numbers.
2. Lecture Transcriptions: Contains information with Lecture Names, Unit Names, Links, start times, and end times.

Your task:

- Step 0: Write all summaries and keywords in the user's language (English or German), matching the answer language.
- Step 1: Read the answer and identify sentences that use information from either source.
- Step 2: After each sentence that contains used information, add a citation marker in the format [cite:n]. If a sentence uses information from more than one source, include each relevant citation marker.
- Step 3: If the same source (i.e., identical citation details) is referenced in multiple sentences, ALWAYS use the same citation marker (e.g., [cite:1]) instead of assigning a new marker each time.
- Step 4: Existing citation markers already in the answer must remain unchanged. Existing markers: {ExistingCitationMarkers}. When you add NEW markers, start numbering at {StartIndex} and continue sequentially, always using [cite:n].
- Step 5: Return ONLY a JSON object (no markdown, no extra text) with the schema below.
- Step 6: Only include citations for paragraphs that are actually relevant to the answer. If no provided paragraphs were used, return the answer unchanged with an empty citations list.
- Step 7: Always include citations if the answer contains any information from the provided paragraphs.
- Step 8: If both lecture transcription and lecture slide sources are relevant, include citations for both types of sources.

Output JSON schema:
{
  "answer": "<answer text with citation markers in [cite:n] format>",
  "citations": [
    {
      "index": 1,
      "type": "video" | "slides",
      "link": "https://...",
      "lecture_name": "...",
      "unit_name": "...",
      "summary": "1-2 sentences about the cited content.",
      "keyword": "OneWord",
      "page": 12,
      "start_time": "HH:MM:SS",
      "end_time": "HH:MM:SS",
      "start_time_seconds": 123,
      "end_time_seconds": 234
    }
  ]
}

Field rules:
- "type" must be "video" for transcription sources and "slides" for lecture slide sources.
- "index" must match the citation marker number in [cite:n].
- "keyword" must be exactly one word with no spaces or punctuation.
- "summary" must be 1-2 sentences.
- Fields not applicable for a citation (e.g., page for video, start/end time for slides) should be omitted or set to null.

Lecture Transcription rules:
- If a link is available, provide it in "link".
- URL modification for transcriptions: If the URL has a "videoOnly" parameter, remove it. If you know the start time, add it to the URL as a query parameter in the format `?t=ss`, where `ss` is the start time in seconds.
- You are given the time in HH:MM:SS AND in seconds. Use the seconds value for the URL; use the HH:MM:SS format for the citation fields.

Lecture Slides rules:
- If a link is available, provide it in "link".

Below the answer, the following information is provided:

- Answer without citations:

- Paragraphs with their Lecture Names, Unit Names, Links and Page Numbers for lecture slides:
  {Paragraphs}

- Paragraphs with their Lecture Names, Unit Names, Page Numbers, Links, start times and end times for lecture transcriptions:
