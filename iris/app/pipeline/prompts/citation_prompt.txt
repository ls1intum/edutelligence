In the paragraphs below you are provided with an answer to a question. Underneath the answer, you will find two sets of source paragraphs:

1. Lecture Slides: Contains information with Lecture Names, Unit Names, Links, and Page Numbers.
2. Lecture Transcriptions: Contains information with Lecture Names, Unit Names, Page Numbers, Links, start times, and end times.

Your task:

- Step 1: Read the answer and identify sentences that use information from either source.
- Step 2: After each sentence that contains used information, add a citation in square brackets. Decide whether the used information comes from a lecture slide or a lecture transcription or both and format the citation accordingly.
- Step 3: At the end of the answer (after two empty lines), list all citations—one per relevant source—using the formats described below.
- Step 4: Only include citations for paragraphs that are actually relevant to the answer. If no provided paragraphs were used, output !NONE! without any citations.
- Step 5: Always include citations if the answer contains any information from the provided paragraphs.

Citation Formats:

1. For Lecture Transcriptions:
   - Format with a link available:
     [X] <a href="URL">"Lecture title", "Lecture unit title", page number, start time, end time</a>.
   - If no link is available, do not include a clickable link; simply output the citation text (e.g., "Lecture title", "Lecture unit title", "page number", start time, end time).
   start and end times should be displayed in the format hh:mm:ss

2. For Lecture Slides:
   - Format with a link available:
     [X] <a href="URL">Lecture title, Lecture unit title, page number(s)</a>.
   - If multiple pages from the same lecture slide source are used, list the page numbers separated by commas:
     [X] <a href="URL">Lecture title, Lecture unit title, page number1, page number2, page number3</a>.
   - If no link is available, output the citation without a clickable link, e.g.,
     [X] "Lecture title", "Lecture unit title", "page number(s)".

Example:

If the answer is:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit [1]. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua [2].

Then the citation list at the answer end might be:
[1] <a href="https://example.com/1234?t=12">Slide 6, start at 00:00:12, end at 00:00:15</a>.
[2] <a href="https://example.com/1234?t=17">Lecture Title, Unit Title, page 7</a>.

Below the answer, the following information is provided:

- Answer without citations:
  {Answer}

- Paragraphs with their Lecture Names, Unit Names, Links and Page Numbers for lecture slides:
  {Paragraphs}

- Paragraphs with their Lecture Names, Unit Names, Page Numbers, Links, start times and end times for lecture transcriptions:
  {TranscriptionParagraphs}

Important:
- If the answer does not contain any information from the provided paragraphs or if there are no paragraphs, output !NONE! without any citations.
- Ensure there are two empty lines between the rewritten answer (with in-text citations) and the citation list at the end.
