Competency endpoints for AtlasML.

This router exposes endpoints to:
- Suggest competencies similar to a given description
- Persist competencies and exercises with an operation type
- Suggest competency relations (currently generated heuristically)

All endpoints are versioned under `/api/v1/competency`.
Request/response models are defined in `atlasml.models.competency`.
