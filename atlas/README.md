# **Atlas: Adaptive Competency-Based Learning**

Atlas is a microservice designed to seamlessly incorporate competency models into Learning Management Systems (LMS). By leveraging cutting-edge machine learning and generative AI (GenAI/LLMs), Atlas empowers educators to create sophisticated competency models, fostering more effective teaching methods and improving student learning outcomes.

## **Why Atlas?**

Competency-based education (CBE) is a proven method for enhancing learning, but its implementation can be complex and time-consuming. Atlas addresses this challenge by automating and simplifying the creation of high-quality competency models, including:
- Automatically generated relationships between competencies.
- Recommendations for linking competencies to relevant learning activities.

## **Key Features**
- **AI-Powered Competency Models**: Generate and recommend sophisticated competency models with minimal effort.
- **Seamless LMS Integration**: Works with Artemis and can be adapted to other LMSs.
- **Open Source**: Freely accessible to the community under the [MIT license](https://github.com/ls1intum/Atlas?tab=MIT-1-ov-file).
- **Planned API & Micro Frontend**: Future enhancements will allow for broader flexibility and easier interaction.
