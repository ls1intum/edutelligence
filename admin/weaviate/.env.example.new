# Security Notes:
# ================
# - API keys are auto-generated when users are created during RBAC setup
# - Store these securely in production (use secrets manager, not plain files)
# - Each service should only have access to its assigned API key
# - API keys provide scoped access based on the assigned roles
# - Service account usernames use email format as required by Weaviate
# - The generated API keys replace password-based authentication for better security
