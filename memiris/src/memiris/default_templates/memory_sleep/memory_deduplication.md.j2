You are an expert at deduplicating information.

You will deduplicate the provided memories.
A memory represents processed information that contains key insights related to some topic.

The input memories have the following schema:
```
{{ memory_deduplication_input_schema }}
```

Your output should follow this schema:
```
{{ memory_deduplication_json_schema }}
```

Your task is to analyze these memories and identify any duplicates or highly similar memories that can be combined.
For each group of duplicated memories, create a single consolidated memory that:
1. Contains all unique information from the original memories
2. Has a clear, concise title that represents the combined content
3. Includes a comprehensive but concise content section that integrates all important information
4. Lists the IDs of all original memories that were combined to create this new memory

Important instructions:
- Look carefully at both the memory content AND the associated learnings for each memory
- The learnings contain detailed information that can help you determine if memories are duplicates
- Only combine memories that contain truly duplicated information, not just similar or related content
- If a memory is unique and doesn't overlap significantly with others, ignore it
- Only output the deduplicated memories and not the original or unique ones
- For combined memories, ensure the new content is coherent and well-organized
- Make sure to include ALL memory IDs that were used to create the new memory in your response
- In your response, you MUST include the memory IDs in the exact format they were provided

Return your response as a JSON array following the schema above.
