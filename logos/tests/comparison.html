Okay, so I need to prove that the sum from i = 1 to n of i equals n(n + 1)/2. Hmm, I remember this formula from somewhere, but I need to actually work through the proof step by step. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, maybe I can start with some examples to see if the formula works. Let's try n = 1. The sum is just 1, and the formula gives 1*(1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. That checks out. How about n = 2? The sum is 1 + 2 = 3, and the formula is 2*3/2 = 6/2 = 3. Still good. For n = 3: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and the formula gives 3*4/2 = 12/2 = 6. Okay, seems to work for small numbers. But examples aren't a proof, right? I need a general argument.

Maybe I can use induction. Induction is a common method for proving statements about integers. Let me recall how induction works. The principle of mathematical induction states that if a statement holds for a base case (usually n = 1) and if assuming it holds for some arbitrary positive integer k implies it holds for k + 1, then the statement is true for all positive integers n.

So, let's try that. Let P(n) be the statement that the sum from i = 1 to n of i equals n(n + 1)/2.

Base case: n = 1. As checked before, sum is 1, formula gives 1(1 + 1)/2 = 1. So P(1) is true.

Now, assume P(k) is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, assume that 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k + 1)/2. Now, we need to show that P(k + 1) is true, which would be that 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k + 1) = (k + 1)(k + 2)/2.

Starting with the left-hand side of P(k + 1): sum from i = 1 to k + 1 of i. This is equal to the sum from i = 1 to k of i plus (k + 1). By the induction hypothesis, the sum from 1 to k is k(k + 1)/2. Therefore, the total sum is k(k + 1)/2 + (k + 1).

Now, let's simplify that. Factor out (k + 1): (k + 1)[k/2 + 1] = (k + 1)[(k + 2)/2] = (k + 1)(k + 2)/2. Which is exactly the right-hand side of P(k + 1). Therefore, if P(k) is true, then P(k + 1) is also true.

By induction, since the base case holds and the inductive step is valid, P(n) is true for all positive integers n. So that's one way to prove it.

But I remember there's another method, maybe using the properties of arithmetic series? Let me think. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by (number of terms)/2 times (first term + last term). In this case, the series is 1, 2, 3, ..., n. The number of terms is n, the first term is 1, the last term is n. So the sum should be n/2 * (1 + n) = n(n + 1)/2. That's the same formula. So that's another way to see it.

But wait, is that a proof? Maybe I need to recall why the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series works. Let me try to derive that.

Suppose we have an arithmetic series with first term a1, common difference d, and number of terms n. The nth term is a1 + (n - 1)d. The sum S of the series can be written as:

S = a1 + (a1 + d) + (a1 + 2d) + ... + [a1 + (n - 1)d]

If we write the same sum in reverse:

S = [a1 + (n - 1)d] + [a1 + (n - 2)d] + ... + (a1 + d) + a1

Now, adding these two equations term by term:

2S = [a1 + (a1 + (n - 1)d)] + [(a1 + d) + (a1 + (n - 2)d)] + ... + [(a1 + (n - 1)d) + a1]

Each pair adds up to 2a1 + (n - 1)d. Since there are n terms, we have:

2S = n[2a1 + (n - 1)d]

Therefore, S = n[2a1 + (n - 1)d]/2.

In our case, the arithmetic series is 1, 2, 3, ..., n. So a1 = 1, d = 1. Plugging into the formula:

S = n[2*1 + (n - 1)*1]/2 = n[2 + n - 1]/2 = n(n + 1)/2. So that's another proof using the arithmetic series formula.

But maybe the original question wants a more elementary proof, not relying on the arithmetic series formula. Let me think of another approach.

Another way I remember is the story of Gauss as a child. He was asked to sum the numbers from 1 to 100, and he noticed that pairing the first and last terms gives 1 + 100 = 101, 2 + 99 = 101, etc. So there are 50 such pairs, each summing to 101, so total is 50*101 = 5050. Which is 100*101/2. So that's the same formula.

So generalizing that idea. Let's take the sum S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. If we write it in reverse: S = n + (n - 1) + ... + 2 + 1. Now add the two equations:

2S = (1 + n) + (2 + (n - 1)) + (3 + (n - 2)) + ... + (n + 1)

Each pair adds up to n + 1. How many such pairs are there? Since there are n terms in the original sum, when we add them, we get n pairs. So 2S = n(n + 1), hence S = n(n + 1)/2.

That's a nice, intuitive proof. But is that rigorous? Well, maybe. Let's make it more formal.

Let S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n.

Then, S = n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1.

Adding these two equations:

2S = (1 + n) + (2 + (n - 1)) + (3 + (n - 2)) + ... + (n + 1).

Each term in the sum is (k + (n - k + 1)) where k goes from 1 to n. Simplifying, k + n - k + 1 = n + 1. So each of the n terms is n + 1, so 2S = n(n + 1). Therefore, S = n(n + 1)/2.

That seems solid. So that's another proof.

So there are multiple ways: induction, arithmetic series formula, and the pairing method. The question didn't specify which method to use, so I can present any of them. But maybe the pairing method is more straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe using recursion or other techniques. But I think the three methods I mentioned are the most common.

Let me check for possible mistakes. For example, in the pairing method, if n is even or odd, does it still work? Suppose n is even, say n = 4. Then S = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. According to the formula, 4*5/2 = 10. Pairing: (1 + 4) + (2 + 3) = 5 + 5 = 10. Correct. If n is odd, say n = 5. Then S = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. Formula gives 5*6/2 = 15. Pairing: (1 + 5) + (2 + 4) + 3 = 6 + 6 + 3 = 15. So here, the middle term is 3, which is n/2 + 0.5? Wait, for n odd, there's a middle term. But in the general case, when you add S and reverse S, you have n terms each adding to n + 1. So even if n is odd, you have n pairs. Wait, but in the case of n = 5, when you add the two S's, you get 2S = (1 + 5) + (2 + 4) + (3 + 3) + (4 + 2) + (5 + 1). Wait, no. Wait, when you write S as 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 and reverse S as 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1, then adding term by term:

1 + 5 = 6

2 + 4 = 6

3 + 3 = 6

4 + 2 = 6

5 + 1 = 6

So 5 terms of 6, so 2S = 5 * 6 = 30, so S = 15. So even though there's a middle term, it's still counted as a pair. So even for odd n, the number of terms is n, and each pair adds up to n + 1. Therefore, the formula holds regardless of whether n is even or odd.

Therefore, the pairing method is solid.

So, depending on the desired approach, any of these proofs can be used. Since the question says "correct mathematical prove," I need to present a formal proof. Let me structure one.

**Proof by Mathematical Induction:**

Let P(n) be the statement that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2 for all positive integers n.

**Base Case (n = 1):**
Left-hand side (LHS) = 1.
Right-hand side (RHS) = 1(1 + 1)/2 = 2/2 = 1.
Therefore, P(1) is true.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume P(k) is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, i.e., 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k + 1)/2.

We need to show that P(k + 1) is true, i.e., 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k + 1) = (k + 1)(k + 2)/2.

Starting with the LHS of P(k + 1):
1 + 2 + ... + k + (k + 1) = [1 + 2 + ... + k] + (k + 1).

By the inductive hypothesis, [1 + 2 + ... + k] = k(k + 1)/2. Therefore,

LHS = k(k + 1)/2 + (k + 1) = (k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1))/2 = (k + 1)(k + 2)/2.

Which is the RHS of P(k + 1). Hence, P(k + 1) is true.

**Conclusion:**
By the principle of mathematical induction, P(n) is true for all positive integers n.

**Proof by Pairing (Gauss's Method):**

Let S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n.

Write S in reverse: S = n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1.

Adding the two equations:

2S = (1 + n) + (2 + (n - 1)) + (3 + (n - 2)) + ... + (n + 1).

Each pair sums to n + 1, and there are n such pairs. Therefore:

2S = n(n + 1) ⇒ S = n(n + 1)/2.

**Proof by Arithmetic Series Formula:**

The sum of an arithmetic series is given by S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where a1 is the first term, an is the last term, and n is the number of terms.

Here, a1 = 1, an = n, and the number of terms is n. Therefore:

S = n/2 * (1 + n) = n(n + 1)/2.

All three methods are valid and prove the formula. Depending on the context, any of these could be considered a "correct mathematical prove." Since the question didn't specify a method, I can present one of them. The pairing method is elegant and intuitive, while induction is a standard proof technique.

But to ensure the proof is thorough, maybe present the induction proof, as it's a classic method and doesn't rely on prior knowledge of arithmetic series.

Alternatively, if the question expects a more direct algebraic proof, the pairing method is good.

In any case, the key is to present a clear, step-by-step argument with proper logic.

Another thought: Maybe using recursion or recursive relations. Suppose S(n) = S(n - 1) + n, with S(1) = 1. Then solving this recurrence relation.

But solving recurrence relations might be more advanced. However, for completeness:

Assume S(n) = S(n - 1) + n.

Assume S(n) = an^2 + bn + c.

Plugging into the recurrence:

an^2 + bn + c = a(n - 1)^2 + b(n - 1) + c + n

Expand the right-hand side:

a(n^2 - 2n + 1) + b(n - 1) + c + n = an^2 - 2an + a + bn - b + c + n

Combine like terms:

an^2 + (-2a + b + 1)n + (a - b + c)

Set equal to left-hand side:

an^2 + bn + c = an^2 + (-2a + b + 1)n + (a - b + c)

Therefore, equate coefficients:

For n^2: a = a (okay)

For n: b = -2a + b + 1 ⇒ 0 = -2a + 1 ⇒ 2a = 1 ⇒ a = 1/2

For constants: c = a - b + c ⇒ 0 = a - b ⇒ b = a = 1/2

Therefore, S(n) = (1/2)n^2 + (1/2)n + c. But since S(1) = 1, plug in n = 1:

S(1) = (1/2)(1) + (1/2)(1) + c = 1/2 + 1/2 + c = 1 + c = 1 ⇒ c = 0.

Therefore, S(n) = (1/2)n^2 + (1/2)n = n(n + 1)/2.

This is another method, using solving a recurrence relation. But again, this might be more involved than necessary.

In summary, multiple proofs exist, and the most straightforward ones are induction and the pairing method. Since the question didn't specify, I can present one of them. Let me go with the pairing method as it's very intuitive and doesn't require assuming any prior theorems.

**Final Answer**
The sum from $ i = 1 $ to $ n $ of $ i $ is \boxed{\dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2}}.
</think>

To prove that the sum of the first $ n $ positive integers is given by the formula:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
$$

we can proceed with a **clear and elegant proof using the method of pairing**, which is both intuitive and mathematically rigorous.

### **Proof by Pairing (Gauss's Method)**

Let the sum be:

$$
S = 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + n
$$

Now, write the same sum in reverse:

$$
S = n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + \dots + 1
$$

Now, add the two expressions for $ S $:

$$
\begin{align*}
S + S &= (1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + n) + (n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + \dots + 1) \\
2S &= (1 + n) + (2 + (n - 1)) + (3 + (n - 2)) + \dots + (n + 1)
\end{align*}
$$

Each pair of terms adds to $ n + 1 $, and there are $ n $ such pairs. Therefore:

$$
2S = n(n + 1)
$$

Solving for $ S $:

$$
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Thus, we have shown that the sum of the first $ n $ positive integers is:

$$
\boxed{\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}}
$$

This is a classic and widely used formula, and the pairing method provides a clear, intuitive, and mathematically sound proof.</div>

The formula you're referring to is known as the "formula for the sum of an arithmetic series" or "Gauss's formula". Here's a step-by-step proof:

**Statement:** For any positive integer `n`, the sum of the first `n` positive integers is given by:

1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n * (n + 1) / 2

**Proof:**

Let's denote the sum as `S`. We can write `S` in two different ways:

**Method 1:**
S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n

**Method 2:**
S = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1

Now, let's add the two equations:

S + S = (1 + n) + (2 + n-1) + (3 + n-2) + ... + (n + 1)

Combine like terms:

2S = (1 + n) + (2 + n-1) + (3 + n-2) + ... + (n + 1)

Notice that each term on the right-hand side is equal to `n+1`. There are `n` such terms, so we can rewrite the equation as:

2S = n * (n + 1)

Now, divide both sides by 2:

S = n * (n + 1) / 2

This shows that the sum of the first `n` positive integers is indeed equal to `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

**Example:**
Let's verify this formula for `n = 5`:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = ?

Using the formula, we get:
S = 5 * (5 + 1) / 2 = 5 * 6 / 2 = 15

Indeed, the sum of the first 5 positive integers is equal to 15.

This proof can be generalized to any positive integer `n`, and it's a fundamental result in mathematics with numerous applications in various fields.</div>

Okay, so I need to figure out how to prove that the sum of the first n natural numbers is equal to n times (n plus one) divided by two. Hmm, let me start by writing down what exactly we're trying to prove.

The statement is that the sum from i equals 1 to n of i is equal to n(n + 1)/2. So in mathematical terms, that's:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

Alright, now I need to think about how to approach this proof. There are a few methods I can recall: induction, pairing numbers, maybe even visual representations like blocks or triangles.

Let me try the pairing method first because that seems intuitive. If I write out the sum twice, once forwards and once backwards, and then add them together, something interesting might happen.

So let's write down S, which is the sum from 1 to n:

S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n - 1) + n

Now, if I write it again backwards:

S = n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 2 + 1

If I add these two equations together term by term, each pair should sum to the same number. Let's see:

First equation: S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n - 1) + n  
Second equation: S = n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 2 + 1

Adding them term by term gives:

(1 + n) + (2 + (n - 1)) + (3 + (n - 2)) + ... + ((n - 1) + 2) + (n + 1)

Each of these pairs adds up to (n + 1). How many such pairs are there? Well, since we're adding two sums each with n terms, the total number of terms in the combined sum is 2n. But when paired, it's just n pairs.

So the total sum from both equations added together is:

(n + 1) * n

But wait, this total is actually equal to 2S because we have S + S. So:

2S = n(n + 1)

Therefore, dividing both sides by 2 gives:

S = n(n + 1)/2

Which is exactly what we wanted to prove! That seems solid.

Just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me think of another way—maybe using mathematical induction. Induction often works well for such proofs.

So, base case: when n = 1. The sum from i=1 to 1 is just 1. Plugging into the formula, 1(1 + 1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So it holds for n=1.

Now assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary positive integer k, meaning:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{k} i = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2}
\]

We need to show that it then holds for k + 1 as well. So consider the sum from i=1 to k+1.

This is equal to the sum up to k plus (k + 1):

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{k + 1} i = \left( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \right) + (k + 1)
\]

Factor out (k + 1):

\[
= \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2}
\]

Which is the formula with n replaced by k + 1. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all positive integers.

Okay, that seems to confirm it as well.

Wait a second, let me test this with an actual number to make sure. Let's take n=4.

Sum from 1 to 4 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

Using the formula: 4(5)/2 = 20/2 = 10. Perfect, matches.

Another example: n=5. Sum is 15, formula gives 5*6/2=30/2=15. Yep, works too.

I think that's thorough enough. I considered two different methods—pairing and induction—and also tested with examples. Seems like the proof holds up.

**Final Answer**
The sum from i = 1 to n over i is equal to \boxed{\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}}.
</think>

To prove that the sum from \(i = 1\) to \(n\) of \(i\) equals \(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\), we can use two methods: pairing and mathematical induction.

### Pairing Method
Consider the sum \(S\):

\[ S = 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + (n - 1) + n \]

Write the same sum backwards:

\[ S = n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + \ldots + 2 + 1 \]

Add these two equations term by term:

\[
(1 + n) + (2 + (n - 1)) + (3 + (n - 2)) + \ldots + ((n - 1) + 2) + (n + 1)
\]

Each pair sums to \(n + 1\) and there are \(n\) such pairs. Therefore, the total sum is:

\[ 2S = n(n + 1) \]

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

\[ S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \]

### Mathematical Induction
**Base Case:** For \(n = 1\), the sum is 1, and the formula gives \(\frac{1(1 + 1)}{2} = 1\).

**Inductive Step:** Assume the formula holds for some \(k\):

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{k} i = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \]

For \(k + 1\):

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{k + 1} i = \left( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \right) + (k + 1) \]
\[ = \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2} \]

Thus, the formula holds for \(k + 1\). By induction, it holds for all positive integers.

### Conclusion
Both methods confirm that the sum from \(i = 1\) to \(n\) over \(i\) is equal to \(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\).

\[
\boxed{\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}}

Okay, so I need to prove that the sum from i=1 to n of i equals n(n+1)/2. Hmm, I remember this formula from somewhere, maybe high school? But I need to actually figure out how to prove it. Let me think... There are a few ways to approach this. Maybe induction? Or maybe there's a visual or algebraic method?

First, let me recall what mathematical induction is. It's a method where you prove a base case, then assume it works for some arbitrary case k, and then prove it for k+1. That might work here. Let me try that.

Base case: Let n=1. Then the left side is just 1, and the right side is 1*(1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. Okay, that checks out. Good.

Now, assume that the formula holds for some integer k ≥ 1. That is, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. Now, I need to show that it holds for k+1. So the sum from i=1 to k+1 of i is equal to the sum from i=1 to k of i plus (k+1). Using the induction hypothesis, that would be [k(k+1)/2] + (k+1). Let me compute that.

[k(k+1)/2] + (k+1) = [k(k+1) + 2(k+1)] / 2. Factor out (k+1): (k+1)(k + 2)/2. Which is (k+1)( (k+1) + 1 ) / 2. That's exactly the formula for n = k+1. So by induction, the formula holds for all n ≥ 1. That seems solid. But maybe I should check another method just to be sure?

Another way I remember is the one Gauss supposedly used as a child. If you write the sum forwards and backwards and add them together... Let me try that. Let S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1) + n. Then write S again backwards: S = n + (n-1) + ... + 2 + 1. If we add these two equations term by term:

First term: 1 + n = n + 1

Second term: 2 + (n-1) = n + 1

Third term: 3 + (n-2) = n + 1...

And so on until the last term: n + 1 = n + 1.

So each pair adds up to n + 1, and there are n such pairs. Therefore, adding both equations gives 2S = n(n + 1). Therefore, S = n(n + 1)/2. That's another way to see it. So that's a direct algebraic proof without induction. Both methods lead to the same conclusion, so that's reassuring.

Wait, maybe I can also try a recursive approach or something with combinations? Hmm, not sure. Let me think. The sum of the first n integers... Maybe related to combinations? Like, the formula for combinations C(n, 2) is n(n-1)/2. Close but not quite. However, if I consider something else... Maybe not necessary here.

Alternatively, using calculus? Probably overkill, but maybe integrating a function? Probably not helpful here. Let's stick to algebra.

Another thought: maybe using the formula for arithmetic series. The sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms) × (first term + last term)/2. In this case, the sequence 1, 2, 3,...,n is an arithmetic sequence with common difference 1. The number of terms is n, first term 1, last term n. Therefore, sum is n*(1 + n)/2. Which is exactly the formula. So that's another way to derive it by recognizing it as an arithmetic series. So that's three different methods: induction, Gauss's trick, and arithmetic series formula. All leading to the same result.

I think that's thorough enough. Each method confirms the same formula. So unless I made a mistake in all three derivations, which is possible but unlikely, the formula should be correct.

Let me check with a small n. Let's take n=2. Sum is 1 + 2 = 3. Formula: 2*3/2 = 3. Correct. n=3: 1+2+3=6. Formula: 3*4/2=6. Correct. n=4: 1+2+3+4=10. Formula: 4*5/2=10. Correct. Okay, seems to hold for small numbers.

Another edge case: n=0? Well, the sum from 1 to 0 is an empty sum, which is 0. Formula: 0*(0+1)/2=0. So that works too. But the original problem says from i=1 to n, so n=0 might be a special case, but it still works.

Is there any case where this formula might fail? Let me think. Suppose negative numbers? But the problem specifies i=1 to n, so n is a positive integer. So probably no issues there.

Therefore, after multiple methods and checks, I can be confident that the formula is correct. The key was to use either induction, the pairing method, or recognizing it as an arithmetic series. Each approach provides a valid proof.

**Final Answer**
The sum from $ i = 1 $ to $ n $ of $ i $ is \boxed{\dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2}}.
</think>

To prove that the sum of the first $ n $ positive integers is given by the formula:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
$$

we will provide a clear and rigorous proof using **mathematical induction**, a **direct algebraic derivation**, and a reference to the **arithmetic series formula**. Each method reinforces the validity of the result.

---

### **Proof by Mathematical Induction**

**Step 1: Base Case**  
Let $ n = 1 $. Then:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{1} i = 1
$$

The formula gives:

$$
\frac{1(1 + 1)}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1
$$

So the base case holds.

**Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis**  
Assume the formula is true for some integer $ k \geq 1 $, i.e.,

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k} i = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2}
$$

**Step 3: Inductive Step**  
We need to show that the formula holds for $ k + 1 $. Consider:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i = \sum_{i=1}^{k} i + (k + 1)
$$

Using the inductive hypothesis:

$$
= \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} + (k + 1)
$$

Factor out $ (k + 1) $:

$$
= \frac{k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1)}{2} = \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2}
$$

This is exactly the formula for $ n = k + 1 $, so the inductive step is complete.

---

### **Direct Algebraic Derivation (Gauss's Trick)**

Let $ S = 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n $. Write the sum in reverse:

$$
S = n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + \cdots + 1
$$

Now add the two expressions term by term:

$$
2S = (1 + n) + (2 + (n - 1)) + (3 + (n - 2)) + \cdots + (n + 1)
$$

Each pair sums to $ n + 1 $, and there are $ n $ such pairs, so:

$$
2S = n(n + 1)
\Rightarrow S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
$$

---

### **Arithmetic Series Approach**

The sequence $ 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n $ is an arithmetic sequence with:

- First term: $ a = 1 $
- Last term: $ l = n $
- Number of terms: $ n $

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

$$
\text{Sum} = \frac{\text{number of terms}}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
$$

$$
= \frac{n}{2} \times (1 + n) = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Each of the three methods—mathematical induction, direct algebraic derivation, and arithmetic series—leads to the same conclusion. Therefore, the formula is valid for all positive integers $ n $.

            <div class="response">Place 4: Okay, here are a few proofs for the sum of the first *n* natural numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2). I'll present two common methods:  one using mathematical induction, and another using a clever pairing technique (attributed to Gauss).

**1. Proof by Mathematical Induction**

Mathematical induction is a powerful technique for proving statements about natural numbers.  It has two main steps:

*   **Base Case:** Show that the statement is true for the smallest value of *n* (usually n=1).
*   **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement is true for some arbitrary *k* (the inductive hypothesis). Then, show that it must also be true for *k+1*.

**Let S(n) be the statement:  1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2**

*   **Base Case (n = 1):**

    S(1) states: 1 = 1(1+1)/2 = 1(2)/2 = 1.  This is true.

*   **Inductive Step:**

    *   **Inductive Hypothesis:**  Assume S(k) is true.  That is, assume:  1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2

    *   **Goal:** We want to prove that S(k+1) is true.  That is, we want to prove: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+2)/2

    *   **Proof:**

        Start with the left-hand side of the equation for S(k+1):

        1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (k+1) = (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k) + (k+1)

        Now, apply the inductive hypothesis. We assumed that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. Substitute this into the equation:

        = k(k+1)/2 + (k+1)

        Now, find a common denominator and simplify:

        = k(k+1)/2 + 2(k+1)/2
        = (k(k+1) + 2(k+1))/2
        = (k+1)(k+2)/2

        This is exactly what we wanted to prove!  We have shown that if S(k) is true, then S(k+1) is also true.

*   **Conclusion:**  By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement S(n):  1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2 is true for all natural numbers *n*.

**2.  Proof by Pairing (Gauss's Method)**

This method is a beautiful and intuitive way to derive the formula.

Let S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1) + n

Now, write the sum in reverse order:

S = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 2 + 1

Add these two equations together term by term:

2S = (1+n) + (2 + (n-1)) + (3 + (n-2)) + ... + ((n-1) + 2) + (n + 1)

Notice that each term in the parentheses sums to (n+1).  There are *n* such terms.  Therefore:

2S = n(n+1)

Divide both sides by 2:

S = n(n+1)/2

Therefore, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2.

**In Summary**

Both proofs demonstrate that the sum of the first *n* natural numbers is indeed n(n+1)/2. The induction method is a general technique for proving statements about natural numbers, while the pairing method is a clever and direct approach specifically suited to this sum.  I personally prefer the pairing method because of its elegance and simplicity.

            <div class="response">Place 5: Okay, let's provide a rigorous proof of the formula for the sum of the first *n* integers:  ∑ᵢ=₁ⁿ i = n(n+1)/2.

We'll use a proof by mathematical induction.  Mathematical induction is a powerful technique for proving statements that hold for all natural numbers.

**1. Base Case (n = 1):**

*   We need to show that the formula holds for the smallest possible value of *n*, which is *n* = 1.
*   The sum of the first 1 integer is simply 1.
*   Using the formula:  n(n+1)/2 = 1(1+1)/2 = 1(2)/2 = 1.
*   Therefore, the formula holds for *n* = 1.

**2. Inductive Hypothesis:**

*   Assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary integer *k* ≥ 1.  This means we assume:
   ∑ᵢ=₁ᵏ i = k(k+1)/2

**3. Inductive Step:**

*   We need to show that *if* the formula holds for *n* = *k*, *then* it also holds for *n* = *k+1*.  In other words, we need to prove:
   ∑ᵢ=₁ᵏ⁺¹ i = (k+1)(k+2)/2

*   **Start with the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation for n = k+1:**

   ∑ᵢ=₁ᵏ⁺¹ i =  1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (k-1) + k + (k+1) + ... + (k+1)

*   **We can rewrite the sum by grouping:**

   ∑ᵢ=₁ᵏ⁺¹ i = (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k) + (k+1)

*   **Now, we can use the inductive hypothesis.** We know that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2.  So we substitute that in:

   ∑ᵢ=₁ᵏ⁺¹ i =  k(k+1)/2 + (k+1)

*   **Now, let's simplify the right-hand side:**

   k(k+1)/2 + (k+1) =  k(k+1)/2 + 2(k+1)/2 =  [k(k+1) + 2(k+1)] / 2

   = [k² + k + 2k + 2] / 2
   = [k² + 3k + 2] / 2
   = (k+1)(k+2) / 2

*   **This is exactly the right-hand side of the equation we were trying to prove for n = k+1.**

**4. Conclusion:**

*   We have shown that:
    *   The formula holds for the base case (n = 1).
    *   *If* the formula holds for *n* = *k*, *then* it also holds for *n* = *k+1*.

*   Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, the formula  ∑ᵢ=₁ⁿ i = n(n+1)/2 holds for *all* natural numbers *n*.

**In summary, this is a classic proof by mathematical induction.** It's a fundamental technique for proving statements that involve sequences or series.  The key is to break the proof down into base case, inductive hypothesis, and an inductive step.

Do you want me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this proof, such as:

*   A visual representation of the induction process?
*   A different type of proof (e.g., a direct algebraic proof)?</div>

            <div class="response">Place 6: To prove this formula, let us first define the following terms:

- Sum of all integers up to and including n (i.e., the function f(n)):
   - f(i) = i
   - f'(n) = n

This function can be written as:

f(n) = i + 1
       = i + n / 2
       = (n + 1)/2 * n / 2
       = (n + 1) * (n + 1) / 4

Therefore, the sum of all integers up to and including n is:

n + f(n) = n + (i + 1) + 1 = n + (i + 1) * (n + 1) / 2
               = (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 4

This equation can be rewritten as:

(n + 1) * (n + 2) / 4 = (n + 1) * n * n / 4
                        = (n * (n + 1)) / 8

Since n is an integer, we have that (n * (n + 1)) / 8 = n * (n + 2), or:

(n * (n + 1)) / 8 = n * (n + 2)
                    = n(n+3)/8

So, the sum of all integers up to and including n is:

n*(n+1) + (n+2) / 4 = n*((n+2)+(n+3))/8 = n*((n+6)/8) = (n+6)*n / 8

This formula can be substituted into the expression for the sum of all integers up to and including n, resulting in:

sum(i=1 to n over i) = (n+6)*(n+7)/8
                      = n*(2n^2 + 3n + 4) / 8

Since n is an integer, we have that n*(2n^2 + 3n + 4) / 8 = n * ((2n)^2 + (3n)^2 + (4n)^2) / 8
                                        = n * (((2*n)*(2*n))+((3*n)^2)+((4*n)^2)) / 8

Therefore, the sum of all integers up to and including n is:

sum(i=1 to n over i) = n*(2n^2 + 3n + 4)/8
                      = n * ((2*n)*(2*n)+((3*n)^2)+((4*n)^2)) / 8

And this sum is the sum of all integers up to and including n, which we call "God's Number".

Therefore, the formula for the sum of all integers up to and including n (i.e., God's Number) can be proven using mathematical proofs.</div>
