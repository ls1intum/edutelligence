      "text": "Team and Group are terms often used wrongly simultaneously but actually differ in on what the work/efforts as well as relationship builds on. \n1. Common goal vs. no common goal\nFor example, in a team the members share a common goal which achievement they are all working towards together collectively. On the other hand in a simple group this common purpose is missing and therefore the members work on their own, just \"next to each other\". A good soccer team has to be, as the word says, a team - otherwise it could never win a championship. Therefore the effort would be collective working towards the goal. Lets on the other hand suppose that in a project group members all had their own personal goal where the different goals might even be partly exclusive, then the people would not work towards this goal together in a shared effort out of belief but only separately on their own. Some members might even have information that would be crucial for another member but due to the lack of sharing of information this would not come through resulting in problems and/or time loss.\n2. Strength of relationship between members\nMoreover a second example is the kind of relationship the members have. In the case of a group there of course is some relationship, but it is only loose and therefore the members are independent and might not even trust each other. In a team on the other hand the relationship is strong and profound resulting in interdependence in a positive way. For example if there is a team in a company they usually split up the different tasks because they trust each other’s capabilities and can therefore work efficiently. If these people on the other hand were acting like a group, this trust would not be there and it could even be that the different members would try to do everything on their own without sharing important information.

One can argue that the common goal is to pass the course, however, this goal is individual as each student has to work independently from the remaining students to pass the module.

In a group, each person is independent and each group has only one leader. But in a team, there can be several leaders, who are responsible for different aspects in detail. The relationship between each member is inseparable and interdependent.\n\nTwo Examples:\n1.For example, if a group achieves good results, the group leader may receive extra praise and attention. But for the TEAM, having achieved good results, everyone will receive the same praise.\n\n2.We can also understand this with the example of a meeting. For example, a group is like a leader talking about a bunch of his ideas and goals, and people below him burying their heads in notes. A team, on the other hand, is a meeting where the junior staff speaks first, then the sub-leader summarizes the statement, and finally the largest leader listens to all the speakers and proposes a collective goal.\n\n",

If everyone in the team would play for herself/himself in a selfish way, their goal to win the match would be impossible.

Participants of a group do not know each other very well and are more likely to work on their own. For example, the students attending a lecture can be considered a group. They do not know each other very well, at least they do not know many, and if there is a task, then they will most likely do it by themselves first. The only relationship connecting the students as a group is the fact, that they need to listen to the lecture.\nA team is defined by people with a common goal and they are therefore more involved with each other. They work together and participants are focusing on specific tasks that are coordinated by the team. Each of the members are complementing each other and contributed to the common goal using their individual strengths. A soccer team is a prime example. The people of that sports team are working together to score the ball and eventually win the game. For that, they need to work together well and each member will know the strengths and weaknesses of the other. They complement each other to strive for their goal.\nAll in all, the biggest difference is the fact that people in a group do not know each other well and also the fact that they do not have something common to strive for. A group can't make things work out, because not everyone will work together, and nor will they reach a consensus if there is something to work on. Their relationship with each other is too brittle for that. A team will succeed because they know how to work with each other and are familiar with it. They have a strong bond and won't back out because if there is something difficult, then they will solve the problem together.\n",

There the participants are strongly connected and all focus on a specific outcome and they require coordination of tasks and activities so the members need to work together.\n\nConsidering both definitions the difference is clear: both the group and the team are a group but the team additionally has a common purpose such that all participants are connected, work together and have the same focus on a specific outcome. \n\nAn example for this difference might be a group of friends. While they all like to spend time together they do not need to have a main goal that they work on together as if the same friend group works on a school project. It may still be the same group but the involvement of the project gives them a common purpose that they did not have before and they now need to work together with the common goal of getting a good grade.\n\nAnother example might be a travel group.

      "text": "As opposed to a group, a team is typically characterized by a specific common goal that all members actively work towards. A team relies heavily on interpersonal communication, coordination and unity.\nOn the other hand, a group usually does not have a defined objective. Its members are only loosely connected and they do not cooperate.\n\nPossible examples of teams include successful football teams such as FC Bayern München. A football team is comprised of multiple players. They all try to contribute as much as they can towards winning games and championships, either by scoring goals or by preventing opponents from scoring goals. They usually do this in a very organized fashion: Every participant has a clear role in the team (e.g. goalkeeper, midfielder, coach etc.) and they tend to help each other out whenever help is needed/required. Additionally, the coach will normally give the players feedback about their performance (the players might also do this mutually) and about how they could improve.\nA different example of a team is a student team working together for a presentation. It is very clear that every member of this team is (or at least should be) very keen on preparing and presenting their topic as good as possible in order to achieve a good grade. In other words, they all have the same goal. They need to coordinate so that everyone knows which part of the presentation they have to prepare and in what order they will present their parts. Since they are supposed to create one full-fledged presentation (not three separate ones merged together), they will undoubtedly need to communicate well so that they can create a sense of fluidity whenever the speaker changes.\n\nThe concept of a group is very different from that of a team.\nAll the people inside a suburban train waggon form a group as they have local proximity in common. However, as opposed to a football team, they do not work together toward a certain objective: The passengers likely have different destinations and most of them probably won't talk to each other since they don't even know each other. Some of them might be heading to their appointment at the barbershop and others might be on their way home from work. Each one of them is responsible for reaching their respective destination and so everybody has a different goal in this scenario.\nSimilarly, all the customers at a supermarket a part of a group. This group is (obviously) identified by the fact that every single one of its members is a customer of the respective supermarket, but all of these people have varying interests with regard to what they want to purchase and how much money they are willing to pay. Oftentimes people will even enter a store without knowing what they want to buy; they will just browse the shop and decide on the fly. In most cases, customers ignore each other and are not aware of any possible relationship with or connection to any other customer.\n\nAs a result of these examples, it (hopefully) became clear that a team is a number of people who actually feel like they are all part of one instance. On the contrary, people in a group will prioritize their own personal interests over those of the crowd.",

Also, every student in the end works on his own, as the exam typically is done alone.\n\nMy second example: In a work team, which programs an app, the workers are highly connected because everyone needs to exchange and there has to be somewhere a boss, which also gets information.

      "text": "A group and team may seem very similar at first, but there are some critical differences. \nMainly a group is a collection of individuals, who work independently and do not share a common goal with each other. A team however is a collection of individuals, who indeed work together. They have a common goal, therefore soft skills start to play a vital role for the proper and effektive functioning of a team. There is a greater amount of communication in a team than in a group, this is due to the exchange of idea about implementation, planning and also reviewing work. To achieve this there is for example agile software development, but it can also be as simple as exchange of ideas or more importantly working towards a common goal as mentioned earlier. These methods help members of a team achieve coordination in the work/project and strive towards a common goal.\nMembers in a group are connected but not as closely as in a team and only share a common characteristic, for example students of Informatics at TUM are all striving for a Bachelors of Science. They are however all working independently for their degree.\n\n1.Example\nA number of individuals are trying to develop a new website for selling used books. 2 people are assigned to develop on the front end, 4 people on the back end and another 2 people to test and review the functionalities, 1 manager. Their first step is planning everything(assignment of roles, manager, deadlines, etc.), then they develop what they were assigned to develop and everyday they discuss on the progress and give feedback, finally they review it. All this requires close group work and the constant exchange of ideas. The individuals are working together, e.g. back end explains the testing team what exactly is important to test. They are constantly exchanging information and working towards a common goal therefore they are a team.\nFew weeks back at TUM we Informatics students were assigned to develop a website with JAVA GUI as homework. We were all trying to get the task done within the deadline and we were all doing the same task, but we were a group because there was minimal to no exchange about the task and most importantly we were all working towards creating and finishing our own website(meaning we had no common purpose). Every website turned out differently(at least in terms of design, since the functions were predetermined by the task) as expected in a group.\n\n2.Example\nThe idea of team also comes up for example in a band. A rock band generally consists of 4 members(a vocalist, a drummer, a bass player and a guitar player). They all have to inevitably always work together when playing a song(also during practice session, there even verbal communication is used). For the guitar player it is not only important to play the right notes, but to also play in coordination with the other band members and staying in sync basically. In order to achieve this the drummer for instance signals the start of a song with three beats, then all members of the band start playing. Moreover they are working towards a common goal, which is playing a song. Obviously communication and coordination in a band is very different compared to a software team, but they are both teams.\nAn example for a group that we see every week is the group of people in a supermarket. They are all in the supermarket to buy groceries, however they are all shopping independently with their own grocery list. There is no communication about the coordination of their activities(what they shop) or what their outcome(What is going to be shopped) is. Nobody in the supermarket is aligning goals with others or in any way dividing the shopping list among the others in order to achieve efficient shopping or diving the cost etc.. Therefore people in a supermarket are a group of people shopping not a team.\n\nIt may seem like teams are only relevant when working on huge projects. Our EIST-Team-Work which will start very soon, will prove very nicely that the idea of a team is also very relevant when working on a smaller project.\nTo conclude a number of individuals all working independently are referred to as a group, whereas a number of individuals working towards a common goal and working together are referred to as a team.\n",

The soccer players work with each other and supports each other closely to defeat the other team. They push eachother during training and are strongly connected by camaraderie and are bound by collective success or failure.\n\nAnother example would be a  collection of athletes from the same country participating in the Olympics. A group would be the athletes from the same country participating in a individual match. They are loosely connected by the fact that they are all from the same country, but their goals are to only win the match themselves, they might do certain training or activities together but ultimately each person's victory is their own.

Teamwork is not needed as it's about individual performance.\n\nA team is a group of people that has a common purpose/goal and is involved in the same activity to achieve a target that each team member is aligned with.

One person in the group might aim to relax on their vacation. Another tourist may have joined the group to study each new sight carefully and learn about its history.

Overall teams are more tightly connected, have internal dependencies of the members on each other and as a rule of thumb are usually smaller than/subsets of corresponding groups.\n\nConsider the ERA-Praktikum for example. The attending students form a group of students, sharing at least the quality of attending the lecture together. They do however not need to communicate to fulfill this quality and omitting one or several members of the group would have little to no influence on the other members or the group as a whole. In comparison, the student teams formed for the project also have a specific purpose for grouping the students, in which the members depend on each other, i.e. completing the project together, do require communication and the composition of the team matters. Omitting one or several members of the team will influence the other members of the team or even stop the team from functioning. For example, the remaining team members might require much more time to fulfill the task of the missing member(s) or be completely unable to fulfill it, due to having different skillsets.\n\nTake any kind of game as a different example. Consider a group of players, sharing the quality of playing that game. If you now group them in two (or more depending on the game...) subgroups with the purpose of facing off in that game, you will have formed two teams. As the members of the one team will have the common goal of their team winning, whereas the members of the other team will have the common goal of their team winning respectively. Also, the members of the teams will usually work much more tightly together than just the members of the group would, as in this case two members of the group might even work against each other (rather than just not working together), due to being in different teams. Teams naturally don't have to oppose other teams in general, but this just illustrates a possibility for forming a subset with \"stronger\" requirements, compared to the group. ",

In contrast, the members of a team are tightly associated in sharing a common interest in the fulfillment of a certain task, like for a handball team the enthusiasm for the sport ties the members together and close collaboration on the field in a match is a prerequisite in pursuing the common goal of winning together. Contrary, members of a group do not share interest in collaboration or a joint goal, instead each individual is focused on its own agenda. For example, the people of a guided group visiting a museum share the relationship of using the same service at the same time and place, but each individual follows its own purpose for the visit being it education, research or a simple holiday activity. Consequently, unlike for a team, no further coordination or collaboration is required among the members of the visitor group. In contrast, for the success of a team - being the acheivement of the jointly pursued goal or outcome a transparent information exchange, mutual regard and the clear assigment and organisation of tasks is absolutely necessary. For example, like for a coworker team assigned with a software development project, clear roles like project leader, software developer, customer contact person etc. need to be defined in order to mark the responsibilities and required work contributions, which need to be harmonized.

They may be strangers to each other, acquainted or even be friends; that however doesn’t influence their status as a group.\nWhereas a team is a tightly knit and well coordinated group of people, that is usually driven by a purpose or has to work towards a common goal. They are capable of working well together, each one providing a crucial skill necessary for the progress of the work.\n\nWe might have a group of friends just hanging out together during their free time, having no other goal though, than just to have fun and spend time together; they are not working towards anything.\nA team on the other hand is for example a film crew: they all work hard on a big project – a film, each person bringing their expertise to the table (actors, directors, writers, cameramen, costume designers, orchestra, props people, stuntmen…); every person’s work is crucial for the film and they have to all be well coordinated because otherwise ... it just won't be a good film. :)\n",

You are at a scouting event and want to make it into the football-team. At the scouting event, you compete a group of 10 other players who want to make it to the team. You don't feel connected to them and you only concentrate on your own work/performance. Your goal is to make it, not sharing a common purpose to also help the others for example. \nAs soon as you have made it, you can find yourself in a real team. You don't have your own goal anymore, rather you work together with your team to win the championship. To reach your common goal, you spend a lot of time together and train together - (share same activities) - to get better. After some time, you know the routes of your teammates, everything gets more precise, tactics evolve.\n\n2) Let's look at work: A good team is coordinating their tasks, every employee within the team has a certain task to achieve the greater common goal - e.g. growing the overall productivity/profitability of the company. All employees work together on this goal, help each other and also celebrate achievements with a common dinner to further strengthen their team spirit. \nOn the other hand, you may also find departments, where goals of single employees differ a lot. This may range from not having to stress out at work over minimal working hours, to outperforming all colleagues. They don't share a common goal, don't communicate that much and only work for theirselves. Thus, as they don't have a strong connection - this department may only be considered as a group of people, rather than a team.",

They have a plan, usually have a scrum meetings or adaptions of scrum\n- A learning group decide on their own when, where and how they want to learn, which methodologies and techniques they utilize to achive their own goals. Scrum meetings are not possible to implement under this conditions\n\n3. Strong / Weak (or no) connection\n- A software team knows every member of its team (usually), their names and other facts about each other. They have a certain relations between each other (serious buisness partnership, friendship or or even love)\n- A learning group could have some relationships, but only ocasionally.

This dosen't mean that this is a strong connection it is more simialr to the wider circle of friends. Once has a close connection to close friends but on a wider scale the connection loses its strength. Every individual of the group has its own goals and targets which he/she wants to achieve by itself. So a group is a number of people with some connection but are not as close connected as for example team members. \n\n\n- Team => the concept of a team is also a number of people, so a group, but here the connection is much stronger due to the fact that the members have the same goal and work hard to achieve this goal together in teamwork. The worked for outcome is for everybody the same which supports the stronger connection and lead so better trust, skill allocation und effectiveness of the overall team. A example for a strong team is a racing team at the Tour de France; the overall goal for each individual or member is to support at all cost the most powerful and highest ranked rider. Only through the support of very team member one cyclist is able to win the Tour de France; the overall win might seem to be achieved by only one person but it is a team effort which make this possible. \n\n\n",

It is important to note here that the word „group“ is actually used within the definition of „team“, thus indicating a hierarchical relationship. While there are various definitions of the term „group“, a generally accepted understanding is that it is „a number of people or things that are together in the same place or that are connected in some way“ (Oxford Dictionary). \nWhile the word „group“ does imply a certain interrelationship between members, any accumulation of people could be defined as a group – such as a group of people standing on a platform, waiting for the same train, but having no true relationship to speak of. A team, on the other hand, requires a group to have a common goal that requires effort to be achieved. Hence, in sports for example, we speak of „teams“, and not „groups“ – these people did not coincidentally find themselves in the same place, but instead all share a goal: to win. Another example is a project team.  Colleagues who spend time together but do not share tasks or projects may simply be referred to as a „group of employees“. However, those who work together to, for example, provide a service to a client, are commonly named a „project team“.\n\nATTENTION: I took EIST last year, but sadly did not pass the final exam, and am therefore reusing my answer from last year.

A group of people do not cooperate with eachother, never pass the ball or even have certain positions. The best example for a group of football players is when 3 year olds play: they all just look at the ball and run after it and try to score a goal on their own. However an adult group is usaully a team, because they all stay on their given position and work together by passing the ball to eachother and therefore trusting eachother to be better as a unit/team than as 11 individuals in a group.\n\nAnother example is rowing a boat with many people. If everybody rows asynchrone the people are considered a group and the boat moves a lot slower than when everybody tries to row synchrone. Only when they all coordinate their strokes in the water could be called a team. They then all want to reach the maximum speed and this can only be achieved if everybody is aware of their teammates and connects with every one of them. ",

It is a set of people who have coordinated tasks with a single or mutiple lectureres who are in charge of explaing the contents of the course to the students.  They are then helped by a group of tutors who make sure that the students can implement the learned skills in exercises. As a team, they work in a coordinated manner to make sure that they are covering the same topics in the exercises which are being taught in the lecture so that the students have no problem. If they were not to function as a team, the exercises would always be on a different topic that has not been covered in the class and the students would not make sense of it.

A team is a group of people who have a common goal they want to achieve. They are both very similar to each other, but can not be seen as the same. A group of people is an assemble of individuals who are, forced or voluntarily put together. They use each others individual strengths in order to function as a social group and to get along with each other. Their assembly is often caused by social needs or organisation. They have individual goals and their personal success or failure does not depend on the group. The members of the group are independent and often tend to have a leader who is in charge of organising the group so that the task can be finished. A team on the other hand tend to have several leaders, respectively tend to work as a unit which decides as one leader. They share the same goals, which causes them to work efficiently with each other. For example: In school teachers would often put students in groups in order to complete a task, like a presentation or something similar. The people in the group do not have to have much in common. Their main reason to work with each other is because they have to complete the task and get a grade for it. Every student decides itself which seems as a success to itself. So Student A could be aiming for an A, but student B would be satisfied with an C. They have different goals and are independent. Due to the different goals, the group is not pressured to work efficiently as they have different views on what would be a satisfying way of completing the task. That is why those kind of groups often have a leader who organises and distributes the task to everyone, so that the task can be completed. A team on the other hand share the same goal, for example a basketball team. They have a common goal and want to win the game. In order to do so they have to work together and they have to be equal to each other. Due to the reason that they share the same goals, they are interdependent to each other. They have to act as a unit and can't exclude or look down on the other members of the team as it would be damaging to them achieving their goal.",

Everyone might have their own goals (e.g., one wants to impress someone). The performance wouldn’t contain the necessary trust to pass the ball to another person, the skill allocation (knowing the strengths/weaknesses of the other players, e.g., one player fast runner).

Everyone would have his/her own goals, e.g., on how to tackle the project. The development of the software would be slow due to missing trust (e.g., view commits of other members to check the correctness). Therefore, software development needs diverse teams with soft skills (communication, collaboration, teamwork, negotiation, presentation). A group can be transformed into a team by 4 stages: 1) Forming (Getting to know each other and establishing a shared vision) 2) Storming (clarifying expectations and establishing client relationships; if there are strong personalities with different standpoints of how to tackle the project, sabotaging behavior can occur) 3) Norming (the team meets and discusses and removes the redundancies which occurred in the previous step) 4) Performing (Build of trust, empowerment, skill allocation)  A software team knows how to contribute tasks to each member as they know the strengths and weaknesses of each other. They trust each other (e.g. don’t check commits of other members of the team) and focus on the same project goal.",

In contrast to a group, a team acts as a united entity and shares a common goal they all strive to achieve.\n\nFor example, consider a hackathon: In this case members of a group would merely work on the tasks they personally enjoy. This would lead to a situation where there are a lots of tasks done redundantly (e.g. coding two websites with two technologies because they have different opinions). Also, no common objective is being discussed, or it cannot be agreed upon, so that the tasks also might not even necessary. They are just people working in their own zone that just happen to sit together.\n\nA team on the other hand would work effectively on a goal that was specified before which is being accepted by everyone in that team as a common goal. Furthermore, all the different tasks are distributed evenly among everyone. Best case scenario would even be that every member has a set area of competence that they are responsible for.\n\nAnother example could be a basketball team. It is even called a team because players have to act in a united way such that they are understanding if someone else makes a mistake or they do not act arrogantly when they scored a point.\n\nIf they were only a group every member would only chase after their personal goals (e.g. scoring as many points themselves as possible) which is often times very distinct from the goal of the entire team (scoring as many points together).

A team arguably is a more emotionally motivated or connected group, that distincts itself from a group, because the team actively tries to work towards a common goal. The members of a team did not meet out of pure coincidence, but for a common purpose. There are two great examples for a group and a team. A soccer team as the team, and a group of tourists, being lead by a guide.\n\nThe soccer team has a common goal. Every person in the team wants their own team to succeed and tries their personal best, in order to win, or at least not to let the opposing team win. In a group of tourists, there is no common goal. While tourists arguably all want to see a certain region or city, they are just together, because of their individual goals of listening to the tour guide, or getting to know the place of interest better. They do not work together, and they do not need to work together in order to achieve their goals. In a soccer team however, all of the players work together with their different and unique strengths and skills in order to succeed in something, that they could not succeed in alone, winning agains the other team.

This means that members of a well-functioning teams must possess certain skills such as communication, awareness for others, open-mindedness and cooperation.

People in a research group generally share common interests but are focused on specific questions that are only shared by smaller collections of individuals of the group.

While all members are friends with each other, their actions like their private life or academic goals or work goals do not affect other members in the group. This is because each member follows their own goals and has an individual and unique strategy to accomplish those goals.",

      "text": "A group of people usually have a loose relationsship to one another, or at least one thing in common which qualifies them as a group. For example you can define all the people who take the course \"Introduction to Software engineering\" as one big group. The participants are have a loose connection to one another as they all watch the same lectures and learn the same contents. However everyone works for the most part alone and any individual doesn't really care whether another person they don't even know passes the course or not. Even though one might argue that we have the same goal, in a sense that we all want to pass the course, we are not collaborating in order to achieve said goal thus not really reinforcing any connection we might have.\n\nA Team on the other hand is also a group of people that in contrast to the group presented above collaborates in order to achieve a common goal. Any sports team works as an example, take a football team. The common goal might be to win the championship, however this can not be achieved by any individual player alone thus forcing them to effectively collaborate. They need to work together in order to achieve the goal. This requires them to coordinate and plan their activities so everybody can do what they are best at.For example one person might only play defense while another only plays offense. Now as a team they make sensible decisions as to who might fill what role best This distinguishes a group from a team. Often times this results in friendships also off the field. As you have to have synergy in order to work together as a team, you have to know each other well in order to know what your teammates might do or not to.  In general strong interpersonal connections help with this, spending more time together training you get to know the style of different people or how they operate. All of the behaviour described above is typical for teams and helps with their major goal of effective collaboration. In groups you often times do not have these things and if you do you have them only with parts of a group maybe a few people but not with a majority.",

They are strongly connected by their goal (the new IT system) and their todos. They work in the same company.

In teams, on the other hand, there is a common goal shared by all members. To reach said goal, interaction and organisation within the team are required. One practical example to show the differences can be found within hospitals. The doctors from different fields could certainly be seen as a group, as they are connected by their occupation, as well as the fact that they all work for the same hospital. Besides that, though, the doctors do not work together or collaborate, as they are all from different fields. Doctors from the same department and doctors and their assistants on the other hand are a team, as they share their common goal of helping their patients, and their common patients at that. Moreover, they have to collaborate, interact and organize within their team to be able to reach their goal of helping their patients. A more common example could be that of a sport team, who all have to work together to be succesfull, and are therefore a team.

Hence, the people are generally not chained to one another in the metaphorical sense, so as to ensure that the group has strong bonds. This in turn leads to the members working more individually and independently, which in turn leads to them focusing on individual goals rather than common goals. Since every individual undergoes his labour on his own, no common aim is shared.\n\nA team of people on the other hand, is a collection of people, where participants are interconnected to one another in a meaningful and powerful way. A bit like in a pack of wolves, every team-member puts the team above themselves, which in turn leads to everyone having each other's backs. This is generally speaking fueled by the team having a common aim, or objective which they are trying to accomplish to the utmost quality. Furthermore, this leads to the requirement of a rigorous and effective way to organize, coordinate and manage business campaigns, tasks and projects. This in turn requires a widespread Team-Mentality where everyone operates as a common entity and where everyone works together.\n\nAn example of a group, would be a nation on a macroscopic scale (assuming a capitalistic system). Everyone is connected in the sense, that they are from the same nation, however, all citizens work for themselves, and on their own, without a direct common goal. A common purpose is only met indirectly, in the sense that the society only functions, when everyone does his or her job, however, the society's members are by no means focusing on a common objective, and the members are by no means strongly connected, rather they are at most barely connected with the majority of people. In fact, the free market assumes constant competition between a variety of business entities (within the context of any business-sector), hence not only are people not strongly connected to each other, but they are constantly competing with each other, by either working for different companies/business entities or by simply competing with each other to constantly try to reach the pinnacle of the business hierarchies.\n\nAn example of a team, would be a team of basketball players. Every basketball player shares the goal of wanting to contribute to and improve the basketball team. Everyone has each other's backs. And everyone is strongly connected, in their objective of trying to win competitions, by constantly assembling the best possible team to face their opponents and by constantly working in a cohesive and united manner, to complement each other's skills. Furthermore, this is done to induce the best possible system of players and tactics for a particular match, by utilizing the talent of the individual players in the best possible manner, as well as aiming to achieve the best-functioning synergistic system.\n",

In a group there is almost never such responsibility and most of the work is individually divided while a team works on the solution collectively. \nOne such example for a group is a newly formed class in a new school year. There are around 30 people who share the same room, teachers and subjects and they constantly interact with each other. Nevertheless not all of them share the same goals and there is nothing concusively binding them together. \nOn another hand an appropriate example of a team would be a school volleyball team. While being in the same institution as a class, the volleyball team shares one goal - to win the game. This depends entirely on the communication and teamwork between each individual player. They are essential for a successful development of a volleball game, where miscommunication for 1 second can cost the victory of the team.

A group is a collection of people whos primary goal is to focus on themselves and less in terms of team work or shared work. Their success or failure is mainly dependent on them instead of the group which they are associated to. On the otherhand, a team is also a collection of people who have a common goal which can be shared between each other and their success or failure depend on the teams effort. Mainly asscociating to the concept of \"we rise together or we fail together\". \n\nBy looking at an analogy of sports, there can be a clear and distinct difference between a group and team. If you consider a sport like basketball, you can take two sides which can tell the difference between a group and team. A basketball group can be considered by looking at an individual performance of a player at the end of the game. The individual aspects of the player will be assessed and the mentaility of the player is to mainly to focus on themselevs within the group of players. Comparing their skill against others to make them better players. However, when a basketball team plays they have a specific common goal which is to win. Durring the game, the players focus of the 5 teammates are to derrive a solution with the coach (shared role of leadership) to establish a way of winning the game which is the primary goal. Each teammate will offer something specific which will allow the team to work collabrotively to achieve their final goal which is to win the game. If they win or loose they do that as a team regardless of the score.  \n\nThe final example I would want to use, is the example at a company which uses different types of leadership styles. The difference between an autocratic vs a democratic leadership style at a company. The autocratic leadership has mainly one person whos delegated control and all the people who work for the leader are mainly judged based on individual performances and based on the sole effort the group runs through one person. In a democratic leadership style it allows more people to give a say and discuss options and have a clear agenda towards the teams goal. The leader is mainly the person to rule the discussions and aspects talked between the teammates. This mainly allows for the team to work collaboratively and discuss goals, plans and strategies. Hence the clear difference between groups and teams is associated in this example with autocratic leadership (group) vs democratic leadership (team) styles. ",

The connection between team members is way stronger than between group members. Team members need to trust each other in order to be productive.

A team, by contrast,, knows exactly which specific outcome it wants to attain through collaboration. Therefore, everybody in a group is still focused on his/her own work and performance with an individualistic mindset, whereas a team has understood that with good coordination together it can achieve more - a common vision is the guiding star.\n\nExamples: \nBefore a football world cup, the individual players are scouted from their club \"teams\" and thrown into the national \"team\", which is actually more of a \"group\" at this stage. Many players have not played together, the connections are loose. Players want to show off their indiviual skills to qualify for the final selection. Then, in the qualification phase leading up to the world cup, the group is growing together more and more  - shaped by the coach and by its own members. It establishes a common vision  and purpose (\"we want to win\" / \"we want to go beyond group stage\"). In the final weeks before the world cup, the training intensifies and the coaches place emphasis on strenghtening the idea of team collaboration, where everybody has a specific role going beyond the role on the pitch. Players truly need to work together to compete on the highest level. There was even a documentary about how Germany excelled as a \"team\" in the 2014 world cup and won despite not having the best individual players.\n\nA second example is actually a personal one: In the TechChallenge course at UnternehmerTUM I met my project members through a virtual matchmaking initiative - initially, we were total strangers to each other. We did not know each other and the only tie was that we had all signed up for this course out of curiosity and to apply some of the theoretical knowledge to practice. Exploring the problem space of food waste in hospitals, we quickly developed a common vision for a software product we could build but it took some time until everybody stopped working on his/her domain of expertise but actually collaborated as a team. The specific outcome we wanted to reach was to win the TechChallenge. By now, we have turned the win into a startup and I would say we have grown from a group into a team and work together very well - even in a remote setting where coordination is key.",
