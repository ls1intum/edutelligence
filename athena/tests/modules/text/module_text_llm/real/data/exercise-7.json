  "example_solution": "SOLID principles are five design principles that help create maintainable and scalable software:\n\n1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change. Example: A User class should only handle user data, not email sending or database operations.\n\n2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. Example: Using interfaces to add new payment methods without changing existing code.\n\n3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. Example: Any subclass of Animal should be able to replace Animal without breaking the program.\n\n4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. Example: Creating specific interfaces like Printable and Scannable instead of one large Printer interface.\n\n5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Example: Using dependency injection to pass database connections rather than creating them inside classes.\n\nThese principles help create code that is easier to maintain, test, and extend.",
