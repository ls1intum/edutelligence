Superclass: Car, Subclasses: PlayerCar and SciFiCar.)* \n- The SciFiCar should not be an actor as it is an internal class of the system.\n\n<ins>Difference between scenario (required here) and use case (textual use case description)</ins>\n- A scenario deals with a single instantiation of a use case using real names for actors and for participating objects, e.g. macOS 11.2, Samsung Galaxy Note 7.\n    - An example can be found in the example Solution.\n    - A natural language scenario lacks the formal structure.\n- A use case is an abstraction of a scenario. It covers more than one scenario. Instead of a real person, we use a role, e.g. instead of “Joe”, we use “Administrator”. \n    - Textual use case descriptions additionally cover Entry- / Exit- conditions and special requirements. The Actor is abstract and not instantiated. \n- See L03 xxxxx\n- Make sure that the students understand the difference between use case and scenario!\n\n<ins>General Grading Scheme:</ins>\n- Drag in exactly **one** of the following instructions.\n- In this exercise, there will be no half points.\n- A textual use case description or a natural language scenario automatically lead to 0 points.\n\n<ins>General Rules</ins>: \n- The 250 word limit is a soft limit, the hard limit is at 500 words. In such cases, please assess the submission with 0 points and reference to the 250 word limit. **DO NOT** communicate the 500 word limit to the students!",
  "problem_statement": "### Bumpers Problem Statement\nBumpers is a game where cars drive on a game board and can crash each other. In each collision, there is a winning car.\nThe car that wins all collisions is the winner of the game.\nThe player can start and stop the game. When the game is started, music is played.\nA car can be either fast or slow. There is one car controlled by the player.\nThe player can steer the direction of the car with the mouse and change its speed.\nThe game should be platform independent.\nIt should visualize different parameters of the car, e.g. the speed, consumption and location of the car. When cars crash, there has to be a sound effect.\nThe game should support different collisions.\nThe determination of the collision winner should be changeable during gameplay.\n\n### Your Job\nCreate your own **formalized visionary scenario** for the Bumpers game:\n- Come up with new functionality that was not addressed in the original problem statement in Lecture 02\n- Your visionary scenario should include **at least four events**\n\n*Requirement: Use your own words and do not just copy the lecture slides nor internet sources! Limit yourself to around 250 words*",

My idea as that the faster the car is the less health it would have and so it would be more vulnerable. The faster cars can get more easily into a benefitial position for the collision (right before left), as they are faster, but the slower cars would have more health so that they could survive 1 or maybe 2 collisions. So every car has advantages and dissadvantages and the player has to decide which cars he prefers.\n\n- I added a collision type . As cars now have health, some cars may be able to survive after a colission. So now we have 3 differnt types of collisions, and each one deals different damage. In the beginning the player can decide with witch collisoin type he wants to play. The smaller the collison, the less the damage and so the longer will the game last, as cars will \"survive\" longer.\n\n-  As the health of the cars will decrease as the game passes, due to the collisions, a \n  player can fully restore his car health if he complettly destroyes another car. (completly destroy means the other car loses and can not go on. If he just wins the collison and the other car \"survives\" nothing happens\"\n\n\n\n ",

As she drives to other\n\t    areas through gates, she meets Bob and manages to hit him, so he loses one point and respawns at his\n\t    start location. He still wins because he crushed more cars than Alice.\n\t8. Because Bob is better at the game than Alice, she requests the Co-op mode instead. Bob accepts, so\n\t    now they now play together against two other players that were online.",

The game aso lets tha AI Cars drive into whichever direction they were randomly assigned to. whenever a car hits a border, the game makes it bounce back from the wall.\nCostas steers into the first car that he can reach and wins the collision. the game plays a crash sound and a short \"ding\" to indicate, that the player has won. The game no longer moves the car, that just lost the collision and deactivates its collision. When Costas reaches the second car, he looses the collision. A loosing sound is played by the Game and it makes a window pop up, reading \"you Lost!\" with a \"ok\" button at the bottom. Costas klicks the button and the game once again makes him choose both car and collsion. Costas presses \"quit\" and the game closes all windows and stops the application.",

      "text": "Bumpers is a game where cars drive on a game board and can crash each other. In each collision, there is a winning car. The winning car gets the points, the losing car loses points (1). The car with the highest score wins the game (2). The player can start and stop the game. When the game is started, music is played. A car can be either fast or slow. If a player's car loses to a slow car, it becomes a slow car (3). There is one car controlled by the player. The player can steer the direction of the car with the mouse and change its speed. Besides that, a player can pause a game (new functionality) in order to avoid potential collision and save its score but in that case the game is paused only for the player and not for other participants, they can still get/lose points. The game should be platform independent. It should visualize different parameters of the car, e.g. the speed, consumption and location of the car as well as the current place on the leaderboard of a player's car (4). When cars crash, there has to be a sound effect. The game should support different collisions. The determination of the collision winner should be changeable during gameplay.",

The determination of the collision winner should be changeable during gameplay.\n\nThe Gameboard should display various types of terrain such as road, grass and mud, which should affect the speed, the rate at which the car turns and it's collision victory likelihood. The terrain should also include obstacles, e.g. a pond, tree, or bollards, which should cause a crash where the obstacle always wins. The car who wins all collisions or is the last left standing wins. If the player wins, the timer stops and their time is added to a leader board, so that they can compare their fastest victory times. If the player loses, the timer stops and time is ignored.",

Bumpers ist ein Spiel in einer dreidimensionalen Welt, in der Autos mit hochaufgelöster Grafik (4K) gegeneinander antreten. Dabei ermöglicht ein Kollisionsalgorithmus das präzise Berechnen von Aufprallflächen von Autos, sodass jede 5 cm Verschiebung bei der Kollision in einer anderen dreidimensionale Verformung des Autos resultieren. Zusätzlich kann sich Thomas nach dem Starten des Spiels für unterschiedliche Kollisionsmodi entscheiden. Danach wählt Thomas das Auto aus, das er steuern möchte, wobei von jeder großen Automarke mindestens ein Model verfügbar ist. Somit bietet Bumpers mit 420 unterschiedlichen Autmodellen die größte Auswahl an Autos der Videospielbranche. Nun muss sich Thomas nur noch entscheiden ob er online gegen seine Freunde oder gegen einen Computergegner mit einstellbarer Schwierigkeit antreten möchte. Da er sich für den Computer Gegner entschied muss er noch dessen Schwierigkeit anpassen. Zu beginn des Spiels beginnt die Musik, welche ein lizensierter Rock song von ACDC ist. Der erste Spielzug von Thomas ist präzise und er crasht einen langsamen Volkswagen, der aufgrund der gewählten \"ExplosionCollision\" in Flammen aufgeht. Doch Dies hat die Ki registriert und attackiert Thomas Auto nun mit stärker gepanzerten Suvs und Militärtrucks. Diesen kann Thomas nicht mehr entgegensetzen. Nachdem er besiegt wurde hört die Musik auf zu spielen und er wird darüber informiert dass er verloren hat. Im wird angeboten mehr Infos über das Spiel einzuholen und im werden Verbesserungsvorschläge für sein Verhalten in wichtigen Spielsituationen geboten. Thomas ist begeistert vom Spiel und empfiehlt es am nächsten Tag seinen Freunden in der Schule.",

He enjoys the game and decides that he wants to buy a new car type that he really likes, a super fast car. Therefore he clicks on the shop button in the game. \n\t2. The game displays different categories for the buyable items in the game, e.g. car types, collisions \n\ttypes and new designs for the game. \n3. Max clicks on the category of car types. \n\t4. The game visualizes a list of all buyable car type items in the shop with the name of the car type, a \n\tpicture of the car, the price and a button to buy the item. Moreover there is a search function provided. \n5. Because Max knows already which car type he wants to buy, he enters the name (\"super fast car\") of his desired car into the search bar and clicks on the button search afterwards. \n\t6. The game updates the list of the visualized car types and shows the one car that fits to Max search \n\tquery with a price of 1.99€. \n7. Max clicks on the buy button of the list item.\n\t8. Because Max's credits with 10€ in the game is sufficient to pay the car type, the game displays a pop \n\tup window with a purchase confirmation button.\n9. Max confirms the purchase.\n\t10. The game deducts the purchase price of 1.99€ from Max's credits and shows his new credit of \n\t8.01€. \n11. Max leaves the shop via the exit shop button. ",

Alex decides that the binary (win/lose) nature of compounding collision victories of the simple game mode has gotten boring. He notices that the pop-up menu upon the start of the game shows a more complex game mode with health bars and power-ups.\n\n\t2. He selects the button for the complex game and the application loads him into a default game board. \t\t\t \t \n \t    Notably, the cars have health bars on top of their icons, including the user's.
