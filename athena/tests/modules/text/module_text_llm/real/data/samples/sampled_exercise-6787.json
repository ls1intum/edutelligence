  "problem_statement": "In order to solve the following task, first re-read Bumpers' Problem Statement.\n\n### Bumpers Problem Statement\nBumpers is a game where cars drive on a game board and can crash each other. In each collision, there is a winning car.\nThe car that wins all collisions is the winner of the game.\nThe player can start and stop the game. When the game is started, music is played.\nA car can be either fast or slow. There is one car controlled by the player.\nThe player can steer the direction of the car with the mouse and change its speed.\nThe game should be platform independent.\nIt should visualize different parameters of the car, e.g. the speed, consumption and location of the car. When cars crash, there has to be a sound effect.\nThe game should support different collisions.\nThe determination of the collision winner should be changeable during gameplay.\n\n\n### Your Job\nDefine in total 6 quality requirements (i.e., non-functional requirements) for the Bumpers game, which should cover all the four different URPS categories.\n\n*Requirement: Use your own words and do not just copy the lecture slides nor internet sources! Limit yourself to around 250 words*",
  "example_solution": "- Portability: Bumpers can be moved from iOS to Android.\n- Usability: Bumpers can be played without reading a user manual.\n- Reliability: Bumpers should not crash more than 1 out of 1000 executions.\n- Performance: The game board should support an update of 25 frames per second.\n- Performance: The cars direction should be changeable within 1/10 sec after steering.\n- Maintainability: Bumpers must be re-designable to a client-server architecture.\n- Adaptability: As Bumpers must support North Americas and European markets, it must support metric and imperial systems. \n- Supportability: The game should be supported on Linux, MacOS and Windows.",
