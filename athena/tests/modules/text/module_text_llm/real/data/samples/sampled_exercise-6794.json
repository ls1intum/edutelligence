  "example_solution": "- Functionality vs. usability\n    - Many functionalities does not necessarily follow usability heuristics\n    - Users might be overwhelmed with too much functionality\n- Cost vs. robustness\n    - Highly robust systems requires higher costs\n    - Example: error handling, security, etc.\n    - Typical issues/trade-offs for start-ups in the mobile app domain\n- Efficiency vs. portability\n    - Highly portable systems are usually not very efficient\n    - Example: a portable real-time game. Frame rates require special graphic cards, which are still very specific to certain machines/operating systems\n- Rapid development vs. functionality\n    - This trade-off relates to the implementation and delivery of a software. \n    - If there is limited time for design, implementation, and delivery with constrained available resources, the functionalities of the software are reduced, in order to ensure on-time delivery.\n- Cost vs. reusability\n    - Assume you model the association between 2 classes with 1-1 multiplicity\n        > Easy to code, low cost tests, not very reusable\n    - Moving from 1-1 multiplicity to a many-many multiplicity\n        > Additional coding and testing costs\n- Backward compatibility vs. readability\n    - Sometimes it is not easy to achieve backward compatibility e.g. due to different hardware. \n",

Let's use the example of a ticket machine. If the machine should just provide the functionalities to book a ticket from a place to another and to pay, the interface will be simple and easy to use. If wen now want it to provide 50 more functions, navigation will become very difficult and make it almost unusable. \n\nThe next trade off is: Rapid development vs. functionality. \n\nA client might want the software for his ticket machine to be developed extremely fast. In a short time frame functionalities, the system should have can't be built as good as possible and some errors might arise later. \n\n\nAnother common dilemma is: efficiency vs reusability.\n\nA very efficient software utilizes the underlying hardware extremely well. This also means, that it is likely built for a certain Cpu architecture etc. The drawback of that is, that the software is not very portable to another hardware architecture, because it is specifically built for the first one.  An example would be pre installed software on Mac OS vs windows. \n",

      "text": "\nTime vs space:\nIn some cases the algorithm of our codes works fast but it needs more storage in comparison with another version of our code, which works slower than ours. In that case we should make a choice according our usage aims of our code.\nFor example: Mergesort  works faster than quicksort ; but merge sort  requires additional memory space to store the auxiliary arrays , while quick sort  doesn’t need any extra storage.\n\nCost vs. Robustness:\nRobustness is an ability of the system to handle with extrem situation/cases. Our program should not only work correctly, but also be resistent against extrem cases, such as any errors or bad intention of some users . But , to write a code, which is robustness needs more time to code it and it's more expensive.\nFor instance: The online banking applications are more robustness against the hackers, since the banking applications are used for monetary processes. Therefore the cost of robustness against the hackers of banking applications or websites are more expensive than a game website.\n\n\n\nCost vs. Reusability:\nReusability is the useage of existing code from  previous projects and writing reusable codes eases the processes of future works/projects. But only high-quality code (bug-free) can be reused.And writing such codes cost more time and money.\n\nFor instance big applications or softwares(such as ios) write their codes in a reusable way and therefore they can reuse again  making some changes and we can use the new softwares by installation of ios.\n \n",

      "text": "Functionality vs. Usability: \nA system can either be very usable, meaning it's easy to learn, having not too many options, or it can be very functional, being powerful but also hard to understand. As an example one could use SAP ERP systems. SAP tools have so many functionalities that many people are not able to use all of them (on top of that it's not very user-friendly if you look at the UI). Therefore there are many SAP consultants helping companies setting up SAP.\n\nCost vs. Robustness: \nThe more robust a system should be, the more tests are required. These tests then also lead to higher cost. Examples for this are online registrations. Inputs of phone numbers and birth dates are mostly strictly prescribed. Any input in another format is declined. This of course grants the provider of any software/social network to have persistent data, but of course as this takes longer to implement, it's also more costly. \n\nRapid development vs. functionality: \nDeveloping a system with a lot of functionalities takes time, but time is money and especially when you look at startups, applications have to be shipped fast, as startups are bootstrapped and must gain customers fast. (E.g. Personio had very few functionalities in the beginning, just enough to gain their first customers. From this point on they constantly developed their Software, for example with several APIs to other systems.) Of course, there were some unhappy customers in the beginning, but still, Personio got at least some money from them to further develop their tool. On the other hand, Personio might not have survived by first working to a fully functional software in the beginning, as they would not have made any revenue.\n\n//some parts taken from my submission from last year - Thomas Schuhbeck (ga84xoc)",
