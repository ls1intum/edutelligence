We will however note this down and if it happens again, the student will be excluded from the bonus.\n- A solution that was >= 90 % copied from the internet/slides/textbook gets 0 points\n\n<ins>General Grading Scheme:</ins>\n- up to 2P for the *Explanation of Why Change Occurs*\n- up to 1P for the *Example of Change in Software Development* (due to ambiguity in the problem statement, accept every example for a (general) change and don't be too strict here)\n- up to 3P for the *Discussion of the three Categories*. (1P per category)\n\n\n<ins>General Rules</ins>: \n- If the student provides more examples than necessary, the worst one counts. (You can still provide feedback, but under no circumstances publish the evaluation guidelines)\n- The 250 word limit is a soft limit, the hard limit is at 500 words. In such cases, please assess the submission with 0 points and reference to the 250 word limit. **DO NOT** communicate the 500 word limit to the students!",
  "problem_statement": "Explain why change happens in software development and provide an example for change in the real world.\n\nAdditionally, explain the three areas of requirements changes, technology changes, and organizational changes with the help of examples.\n\n*Requirement: Use your own words and do not just copy the lecture slides nor internet sources! Limit yourself to around 250 words*",
  "example_solution": "- **Change in software development** can happen because multiple groups are involved in the development. The client may have new demands for the requirements. New or updates to existing technologies may require adaptation of existing product increments. The developing organisation may also go through changes due to new laws, or changing distribution of the workforce.\n- **An example** would be an ongoing pandemic; requiring changes in the workflow of the development team and forcing the client to raise the targeted availability of the end product.\n- **Requirements change** throughout the project, e.g. the customer changes their mind or requirement turns out to be unfeasible\n    - Example 1: during the construction of the Berlin Airport, the requirement of a handling facility for large aircrafts emerged, which led to additional costs and resources\n    - Example 2: the EIST instructors change their minds about how the player can steer their car (using a mouse is just too boring) and now require you to implement voice commands to steer the playerâ€™s car instead\n- **Technologies change**, e.g. new releases, updates\n    - Example 1: since the first release of the Bluetooth specification in 1999, the requirements of mobile devices changed. Manufacturers started to incorporate Bluetooth in their devices, which lead to the expectation, that all mobile devices incorporate the Bluetooth specification in order to exchange data via short distances\n    - Example 2: since updating Bumpers to JDK 10, the AudioPlayer is outdated and has to be refactored. For instance, the AudioPlayer can only play .au and .wav files, but should also support .mp3 files\n- **Organizational changes**, e.g. laws, recruitment\n    - Example 1: WhatsApp was bought by Facebook, therefore new company legal requirements and processes had to be incorporated or replaced the old ones\n    - Example 2: the EIST instructors decide to add 10 more tutor groups and now all the students have to be re-distributed among the tutor groups\n",

The introduction of smartphones is a big milestone, just as much as the introduction of computer games. Also recently VR-devices are being introducted, which require completely new inputs and output, due to their very unique input- and output-system. \nRequirements changes are changes that affect the need for software. With the need for navigational devices in cars for example intelligent pathfinding became really important. This changes the type of software needed and therefore requires a completely new approach. An additional example would be self-driving cars, which need very intelligent programs in order to work properly, which again requires a completely different skillset.\n\nTechnology changes are changes that happen based on the industry developing new more efficient and less pricy devices. As stated before a good example for such changes would be the implementation of VR-Devices or the metaverse overall. New devices require different programming styles and therefore the software development proccess changes with the technology evolving.\nOrganizational changes are changes that affect the development proccess itself. Over time better and more efficient ways of organizing a development team are discovered. One example for such organizational concept is Scrum, a very agile way of working as a team. Back in 1989 software development was viewed as a sort of factory which is easily repeatable with basically no diversions from the plan. \n\n",

In the past Software was only used in business related contexts but now it is embedded in the daily life of nearly everybody. This leads to the fact that not only the time from launching a project to finalizing it but also the costs due to higher automation with improvements decreased. Therefore nowadays there exist plenty of different programming languages in the real world to meet all different use cases that occur out of the peoples demands.\nIn the real world this change can be seen that 4/5 of the most valuable companies 2022 are software companies. While in the past Oil, Banks and Car companies were the most influential ones.\n\nRequirement Changes: as there already exists so much code, one requirment change is to update old code to improve the old products. As the Users want new functionalities and want to use the tools as simple as possible, you need to improve your code on a daily basis.\n\nTechnology Changes: Cloud computing breaks the limits of internet applications as you can offer your software to more people at a lower price. Therefore all big software companies run their systems on the Cloud.\n\nOrganizational Changes:  As todays software is all about the collective growth of the technology, many big companies such as Apple and Google base their inventions on open source systems, which gives other developers the permission to modify the code. Also the working appraoched changed from a linear approach to a collaborative agile environment.",

Because the real world continues to change daily in terms of technology, economy, and politics, it follows that the solutions created to solve the problems must also evolve and change to remain applicable.\n\nThe ongoing coronavirus pandemic is exemplary in illustrating this point. Countermeasures taken by governing bodies worldwide compelled people to alter a significant portion of their lifestyle, which created interest in new markets. The teleconference software Zoom achieved significant growth as a result of widespread use in businesses and other professional environments, as they found the alternatives offered by the likes of Google or Skype had features that were less than sufficient.\n\nChanging the requirements may be necessary when the original version turns out to be infeasible or ill suited to the actual needs of the customer. This may be due to a lack of funds for an ambitious project, technological impossibilities, or perhaps concerns regarding the legality of the project.\n\nOrganisational changes are relevant when for example, new management or new employees are hired to work on the software. This may require the team to adapt to their individual habits, such as preferred work hours, coding style, version control and so on. In order to stay functional the team must then adapt to this change and find a compromise that everyone can accept and supports productivity.\n\nChanges in technology will naturally influence software development significantly. Using the introduction of commercially viable electric cars as an example, this then opens up a new market for software compatible with this technology. Furthermore the use of artificial intelligence can be seen in this field, which is a result of the progress in research and testing.",
