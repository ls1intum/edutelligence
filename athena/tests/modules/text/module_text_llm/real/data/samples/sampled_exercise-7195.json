  "example_solution": "Scrum is a technique to manage and control software and product development when the requirements and the technology may be rapidly changing during the project.\n\n***Advantages***\n- Large projects are divided into manageable sprints to prevent analysis paralysis and to shorten the time until a first prototype is built [vs. prototypes as early as the first iteration of the sprint model]\n    - Example: Bumpers (see L02, slides 33ff)\n- Feedback and change requests can be adopted faster, which leads to a software product that fulfills its requirements in a better way [vs. slower implementation of change requests due to longer iterations and less frequent feedback from the customer]\n    - Example in EIST/Bumpers: ArTEMiS and the tutors provide feedback after each sprint rather than at the end of the semester\n- There is a potentially shippable product increment after each sprint which includes already fully implemented functionality and could be delivered to the end-users [vs. prototypes after each iteration that often get discarded later on. Similar to Scrum, software is produced early in the life cycle]\n    - i.e. lots of testing, the customer can see the progress of the project, ...\n- Feedback can be given quickly when using SCRUM [vs. only feedback at the end of each iteration]\n    - Time to market can be shorter\n    - Example: In Bumpers, after every sprint, there is a new executable version of the game\n- Individual team members' efforts are recognized in Daily Scrum Meetings [vs. non-existence in the spiral model]\n    - Example: In the standup meeting, every team member tells the rest of the team their status, impediments, and promises\n\n***Disadvantages***\n- If a project does not yet have a clear definition, the product backlog is difficult to plan [vs. same problem with the spiral model]\n    - Example Problem Statement: ‚ÄúDevelop a system that assists developers with continuous integration‚Äù\n    - Problem: What kind of system? What are the requirements? What kind of assistance do developers need? What is the domain? ...\n- The customer tends to get lazy [vs. the customer's involvement is not always necessary and less frequent]\n    - Example: Since changes can always be incorporated, the customer may not see the need to specify the requirements at the beginning of the project in as much detail as necessary\n    - *Note: This is a risk when Scrum is not implemented correctly, and it happens quite often in practice*\n- Too much disturbance can reduce the development efficiency [vs. same problem with the spiral model]\n    - Example: Constant change requests lead to uncertainties about whether the requirements are finished. The developers cannot concentrate on their tasks but have to incorporate the changes instead.\n    - *Note: This is a risk when Scrum is not implemented correctly, and happens quite often in practice*\n- Hard to estimate the total cost and duration of the project at the beginning because not all changes are easy to anticipate [vs. cost and duration are difficult to determine at the beginning, but become more realistic as the project progresses, due to important issues being discussed early]\n    - If you allow changes in the process, it is also more likely that they happen üòâ \n    - Example: It is hard for managers to negotiate contracts\n",

      "text": "Core essence\n        \n Scrum is one example of agile software development lifecycle model and technique, that allows a parallel  and adaptive software development. The parallel workflows of Scrum is reached by dividing the software development in smaller parts that can be developed independently  and the adaptive nature is reached by iteratively implementing a short sprints backlog  in a relative short period of time (2 - 4 weeks), shipped the implementation and continuously updated the sprint and product backlog based on the customer's feedback to the prior implementation.\n               \n\nAdvantages:\n- Scrum allows the software development to easily adapt to changes.\n Common example and explanation : After an implementation of a sprint, the product is shipped and then the customer for example wants  to take out the functionality of a feature. Then this will be taken as feedback and then added  to the product backlog, which can be used to determine the next sprint backlog for the next sprint implementation and next shippable product. This is an advantage because in many cases the wishes of the customer can change time to time, therefore the product should be also to adapt to this changes. And this can be reached for example with scrum.\n\n- Scrum allows a quick and efficient delivery of a project. \nCommon example and explanation : In Scrum, a list of items, that is short, will be taken out of the product backlog to form a sprint backlog. Because this backlog is shorter than the product backlog, the development team can focus on a smaller range of work, which is very helpful to maximize the quality of each product after each sprint implementation, and furthermore the implementation can be done quicker than the implementation of the whole product backlog in one go. This is an advantage because focusing on smaller workloads offer often a quicker, easier and higher quality of the software production.\n\nDisadvantages:\n- The chances of project failure is high if the individuals are not cooperative and committed.\nCommon example and explanation : In scrum development team, for example the team members, that developed the backend of a software, give not so much information about its implementation to the tester. Therefore the tester will have difficulties to test the backend part of a software. This can then lead to failure by reaching the project's goals.\n\n- The scrum daily meeting can lead in some cases to unproductivity\nCommon example and explanation : The development team holds the scrum daily meeting at most 15 minute. Assume that the scrum master is unexperienced to control and limit the daily meeting's time. Furthermore assume that there's a development team member, which always want to dominate each conversation and meeting. Then it's possible, that the the scrum daily meeting takes more than 15 minute due to lack of the control of the scrum master and this team member, which can reduce the time to work on the implementation.\n\nComparison with advantages:\n- Scrum adapts easily to change because it's frequent interaction with the customer. This isn't always the case by the spiral model. The spiral model reaches an efficient production of a software mainly  by handling the possible risks that can occur and not by interacting with the customer. Therefore the spiral model adapts to the changes usually not as easy as scrum  due to less interaction with the customer\n\n-  Scrum allows a quick and efficient delivery of a project by a parallel development of the system's components. On the other hand the spiral model isn't always quick in delivering the product to the market. The reason is that the spiral model rely mainly on the possible occurring risk identification and handling and sometimes this risk identification and handling could take a lot of resources ( one of them is time ), if the  individuals, that should identify and handle these risks, aren't expert in risk analysis.\n\nComparison with disadvantages :\n- Both scrum and spiral model involves team to develop a software. So both of these models can have this disadvantage, but maybe in different form. For example, in the spiral model, the experts that analyze the possible risks communicate poorly with the other team members and therefore the project could also fail due to the lack of communication and high dependency to the analysis of the possible occurring risks.\n\n-  The Spiral model doesn't necessarily have a daily meeting and therefore from the perspective of unnecessary daily meetings, the spiral model could be better in productivity than the scrum model, as long as the communication between the developers is sufficient. \n\n\n\n\n ",

In a sprint, every team member except the Product Owner (Who ‚Äúshould buy‚Äù the product at the end) gets tasks that have to be done in the sprint. Such sprints usually take about 1 to 4 weeks. Also, there is a daily team meet up where the team talks about what was successful, what not and where they need help.\n\nA big advantage of scrum is the daily meetings, because in that way you can solve blocking problems fast with the help of your team members. For instance, you are debugging a new python script that automates sales documents and there you just can't solve a problem. In that case, your team members can easily help you after the daily meet up. \nFor me personally, I don't understand why there is only one Product Owner, because the customer base is often big with several interests. Therefore, we require more than one opinion‚Äîbetter would be a hundred opinions! So, for example, one customer just wants to have a good documentation and another wants to get an API ‚Üí Several construction sites.\nBut SCRUM divides big goals like OKRs into partial goals that are easily to reach! Disadvantage: How to divide big goals into partial goals? Might be hard, looking at long-term projects with a goal to reach in 5 years. \n\nThe spiral model seems to me not to be optimized for ongoing processes, but software development is an ongoing process. SCRUM  as comparison is an ongoing process.\nAlso, when using the spiral model, you don't have partial goals that make it easier to understand the whole problem. \n\n\n",

      "text": "Scrum is an empirical process control model. It works by means of iteratively creating increasingly more complex product increments. An iteration is called sprint and lasts 2-4 weeks, after which a potentially ship-able package is ready. If the deadline is still away another sprint is started.\n\nOne advantage of Scrum is the fundamental structure, which follows the divide-and-conquer principle of dividing a large and complex process into several smaller and more easily completed sprints. For example the merge sort algorithm works in a similar way. First the list is divided into smaller parts, such that the sorting of the parts becomes trivial. Then the parts are merged back together.\n\nAnother advantage is transparency. Through the daily meetings all team members are aware of the progress made by other team members. This helps with planning the next sprint and figuring out which members are productive. As an example in school projects there was always a team member who didn't do anything and ended up receiving credit where no credit was due. The teacher not being involved in the development phase wouldn't know.\n\nWhile the daily meetings can be beneficial in large groups they can become a hindrance. For example, when the daily meeting is held and everyone has to present their progress, this would take forever if the group is too big. This would end up wasting time which you never have enough of. \n\nFurthermore, it can be difficult to tell if the project is making sufficient progress in the grand scope.  Because the next sprint is planned after the last sprint completed. Therefore, someone working in management won't be able to tell , whether he can tell shareholders if the project is on track and will be completed on time.\n\nThe spiral model has the whole process planned. So it's easy to determine the progress made. Scrum doesn't plan into the future. The spiral model is linear, which means that steps are completed after each other where as in SCRUM, different teams can work on entirely different components at the same time.\n\n",

      "text": "Scrum is a framework of an agile methodology for effective collaborations among teams working on complex products. The Scrum Team consists of Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team. Scrum defines 3 artifacts: Product backlog, Sprint backlog and Potentially shippable product increment. The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is needed in product, whereas Sprint Backlog is a set of Product backlog items that team tries to achieve in a given Sprint. Product increment is the sum of all Product Backlog Items completed during a Sprint (Time-box uo to 1 month during which the team creates a potentially shippable product increment and have constant durations throughout project). Also in Scrum is Daily Scrum-a every day 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to inspect progress toward the spring goal. Of course, there are some pros and cons of Scrum. Scrum ensures effective use of time and it's an adoptive framework, which means that changes in requirements won't affect rapidly negative, conversely, based on feedback from customer and stakeholder it can enhance product. On the other hand, as it was mentioned, scrum is team based, which means if any team member leaves in the middle of a project, it can have a huge negative impact on the project and the framework can be successful only with experienced team members. For example, during project, suddenly, customer comes with new requirements and demands to add new features on a later stage, in case of SCRUM, it's not going to be increadibly time-consuming and difficult, because it's easy in SCRUM to adopt to changes and as tasks are divided into team members, it wouldn't cost so much time. However, when suddenly one of the team members decide to give up on a project, it will create chaos, because it will cost time to replace this team member and find experienced one. Actually, in order to create a product based on SCRUM framework, it's neccesary for team to consist of experinced developers, which is almost always hard to fulfill. In case of Spiral Model, we also can add new features on a later stage. However, in Spiral Model the successful completion of the project is very much dependent on Risk Analysis. Without very highly experienced experts, it is going to be a failure to develop a project, as was mentioned before with SCRUM.",

      "text": "SCRUM is a method that actively deals with changes and participates it during the development. If actually welcomes changes as potential advantage.\nAll desired requirements, functions and features of the new product are specified in the product backlog (which can change all the time, e.g. if the customer decides for a new feature or to use a different hardware). Form this we select a few items in the sprint backlog (which cannot change after selection anymore) and process them in the next sprint. There are 2 kinds of sprints (major sprint 2-4week and daily sprints). After each sprint we have a sprint review and a potentially shippable product increment. We therefore build the product step by step with this little increments which makes us very flexible and we can actively adopt for changes during the process. Communication is improved because there are regular meetings and everyone has a special role (product owner, scrum master, scrum team members) that help to make sure every aspect and perspective is assessed. e.g. the product owner has the perspective of the customer and might see bottlenecks in the customers system faster than other team members that are focused on other aspects of the project. SCRUM therefore helps to improve risk management (by early realization of risk factors and flexibility to attack these), communication and cooperation. e.g. if a method is not feasible or performed not good enough this could show up early in the process and developers can attack these issues in the next sprint. In a spiral model is could happen that these problems are not discovered for a long time (because they come at the end of the spiral) and changes are then not easily possible anymore within the available resources.\nThe sprial model might have the disadvantage that the customer does not regularly participate in the process and cannot give feedback. SCRUM therefore helps because every product increment can be shown to the customer and changes of the product backlog are welcome. E.g. if the customers frequently changes his mind it is not a big problem for SCRUM to adapt.\n\nSCRUM has all advantages of the Spiral model because in every major sprint you go throw all development activities (like in the spiral). Furthermore, SCRUM enables the developers to go back more easily and flexible and therefore welcome changes, which might not be so easy (if possible at all) in the spiral. In this sense the SCRUM model is a natural next stage in software development.",

SCRUM helps team to manage with complex - and frequently changing problem. One of the advantage of scrums is that it can quickly accommodate changes. It has the advantage of being able to quickly accommodate user feedback through sprints and quickly improve problems to the next sprint. In addition, scrums have the advantage of helping to solve problems efficiently by dividing large problems into small problems. I will explain making a flight ticket reservation system as an example. If the goal of the first sprint was to complete the ability to select and book travel dates, you can immediately feedback on what areas of the feature should be improved and supplemented immediately after the first sprint and reflect it in the next sprint. In addition, if the search and reservation functions are completed in the first sprint, at the second sprint calculating flight time and completing the seat reservation system could be the next goal increment of sprint. In this way, makes SCRUM to complete the project by dividing the entire project into small goals. Scrum, however, has the disadvantage of being difficult to plan, structure, and organize in projects without a clear purpose or definition. In addition, if not all members actively participate in the project, it can easily lead to project failure. For example, if \"what functions should be produced through a print?\" is not defined, the schedule of the project is not accurately defined, which can lead to difficulties in planning.  In addition, team members need to know their roles clearly and perform them so that projects can be successfully completed within a set sprint period. Because scrums are repetitions of tasks that require quick and accurate calculation within a set period of time. The conventional spiral structure, like scrums, has the advantage of being able to actively accept consumer feedback, but unlike scrums, it also has the advantage of being able to manage risk. However, the disadvantage is that the spiral structure requires longer time than the scrum and is expensive, making it unsuitable for small projects. Conversely, scrums have the advantage of being used for small projects because they use a light-weight framework.\n",

      "text": "At its core, scrum is a framework which structures a work method for the development of software products. It's composed of the scrum team, which holds short and efficient daily meetings based upon a sprint backlog which contains the features that need to be implemented in the upcoming work sprint. After the work has been completed, the scrum team comes together again for a sprint review, where the members explain what they've accomplished in search for feedback, as well as a sprint retrospective, during which the team reflect upon their own work in order to ameliorate or solve issues. Then the process starts anew. \nThis carries some obvious advantages. It provides stakeholders i.e. the people financing the development, a clear and concise up-to-date evolution of the product, thanks to the daily meetings. The daily sprint reviews also permits the integration of feedback directly into the development. For example, as a shareholder, you can see what the newest functioning features are and test then out for yourself. Compared to this, the spiral model has no defined meetups.\nAnother big advantage is that it almost guarantees an effective use of resources, namely time and money. Indeed, as the entire team keeps track of what is done every day, the misallocation of resources can be reduced upon identification. An example for this could be the renting of a server for testing purposes. If the programmers notice during the meetings that they don't use it enough to justify costs, they can cancel it and save funds. Our previous model doesn't have this, because there isn't any clear method of gaining an overview of the progress made by the team.\nHowever, the method doesn't only carry positives. For example, due to the rapid development nature of the product, guaranteeing quality isn't a very easy task. Indeed, more emphasis will be placed solely on the implementation of features. In developing a UI for example, it might perhaps function on test devices but not appear properly on all. In this regard, our previous model has a clear testing phase.\nOne last disadvantage is that Scrum is highly dependent on its members to stay focused on the work for the entirety of the project. For example, if one programmer isn't focused on his part, the entirety will suffer because of the lack of implementation. The spiral model once again doesn't have this concept of a daily feedback loop where tasks are assigned and therefore isn't as impacted. \nThank you for listening!",

      "text": "In SCRUM, there is a product backlog, representing all deliverable items for a project and a sprint backlog, representing deliverables for that sprint, a constant time unit. At the beginning of a project, there is a project kick-off to define deliverables, afterwards the SCRUM master organizes sprint planning meetings defining the sprint backlog before, daily SCRUM meetings during and a review and retrospective meeting to discuss the status of the project and what could be done better after each sprint. At the end of each sprint, the development team has a potentially shippable product increment ready which is reviewed by the product owner. \n\nOne advantage of SCRUM is that it is agile, meaning it is suited for dealing with change coming from competitors or new technologies. An example would be if the competitor of a gaming company comes out with a product featuring character customization. As items can be added to the product backlog even during the project the company can stay competitive by adding customization. The spiral model has an iterative approach, it is not quite as suited towards dealing with changes. \n\nAnother advantage of SCRUM is that is encourages communication between all members of the team, regardless of roles, making the team more efficient. For example, the product owner can speak directly with the development team (rather than through the SCRUM master) to communicate more clearly on goals and feasibility for an item. For the spiral model, there are no defined roles or communication rules, it is neither discouraged nor encouraged.\n\nA disadvantage of SCRUM is that there is no clear prioritization scheme for backlog items. Taking large projects (with large product backlogs) as an example, the development team could become overwhelmed with the amount of items, or problematic prioritization rules, e.g. not considering dependencies of items, could cause issues later in the project. The Spiral model has a prioritization rule, starting with the highest risk item. \n\nAnother disadvantage could be that measuring progress can be difficult in SCRUM as 1. the product owner can change and add requirements during the project and 2. progress is based on acceptance of product increments. For example, when a product increment is not accepted, it may be demotivating to the development team if their effort is not recognized at all. In the spiral model, progress is measured by resolved risks. ",

      "text": "What is SCRUM? In essence, it is a technique used to deal which and control change in software development. Because of good communication with the customer and continues delivery of product increments, risk is minized.\nA huge advantage of scrum is dealing with change. By working in small increments, which produce a shippable product, the state of the product and where it's headed to is clear. A common example would be the customer requesting a large video on the frontpage, but upon seeing the first version, he realizes it doesn't fit at all and wants a simple text instead. The customer can see what is happening, and provide immediate feedback, without loosing too much work.\nAnother advantage of scrum is the constant monitoring of remaining tasks. The scrum master can see how much tasks are left, and if it is moving along according the time plan, and if not, make quick adjustments. Often, developers hear in a daily scrum that others are having problem and can directly help them if they know the solution. Knowing a vacation is coming up, developers can easily grap fewer tasks for the sprint.\nA disadvantage of scrum is being limited to smaller teams. Besides trying things like scrum of scrums, generally bigger teams don't work in scrum, since there would be too much too individually coordinate. A common example are the daily scrums, where a lot of developers would lead to long daily scrums, which are not the point of the meetings.\nNevertheless, the biggest disadvantage of scrum is the amount of meetings. Besides being annoying, commonly having at least three big meetings each month wastes a lot of time that could be spent actually working.\nIn comparison, while the spiral model is iterative, it is not as flexible with change as scrum. Generally having a detailed plan of tasks, the spiral model is always clear in what to do next and is not limited to smaller teams. Having no fixed amount of meetings, it can be more pleasent for developers.",

      "text": "Core Essence of SCRUM\n\tSCRUM is a software development management process that enables transparency and collaboration \twithin the development team and allows the team to respond to frequent change. The process is comprised of several consecutive periods called Sprints, wherein the mission is to complete the respective goals set for that sprint and produce a shippable product increment that can be displayed to the product owner and key stakeholders in the sprint review meeting. Change is probable to occur to the SCRUM team must be adaptable and agile in their development process.\n\nSCRUM Advantage 1\n\tSCRUM provides transparency within the development team.\n\nExample) \n\tAt the daily sprint meeting, each development team member is asked what they accomplished since the last daily meeting, what impediments are standing in her way, and what she will accomplish by the next daily meeting. This way, every team member is kept abreast of the development team‚Äôs progress.\n\nComparison to Spiral\n\tIt is not common protocol to provide daily updates to the rest of the development team, so there is less transparency within the development team.\n\nSCRUM Advantage 2\n\tSCRUM allows for agile software development. \n\nExample) \n\tThe product owners can remove, add, and alter items in both the product backlog and the sprint backlog, so the development team must be adaptable to change.\n\nComparison to Spiral\n\tThe Spiral method allows for change at certain periods, but change cannot occur within one of the four major activities.\n\nSCRUM Disadvantage 1\n\tIt is possible that the development team will not be fully committed to developing the best possible versions of each sprint item because if the respective sprint backlog item is changed by the product owner, then it is possible that this extra effort may be in vain.\n\nExample)\n\tA developer has the opportunity to implement an extra functionality in the class she is working on that could be useful to the client but opts to stick to the minimum requirements in the sprint backlog because she does not know if the backlog item will end up being scrapped.\n\nComparison to Spiral\n\tIn Spiral, change cannot occur within an activity, so the developers at least know that what they are currently working on will not be scrapped before the next activity occurs.\n\nSCRUM Disadvantage 2\n\tWhile it is possible to have the SCRUM methodology applied to multiple SCRUM teams, in general SCRUM does not scale extremely well.\n\nExample)\n\tIf there is a very complex project that requires many developers, then SCRUM may not be suitable because the team members may not be able to interact as frequently or as intimately as is ideal for SCRUM.\n\nComparison to Spiral\nSpiral does not require as many team discussions and meetings as does SCRUM, so a large project requiring many developers may not be a significant of a hindrance to the Spiral methodology.\n",
