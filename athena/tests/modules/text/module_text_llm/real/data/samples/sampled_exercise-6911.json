  "example_solution": "Inheritance reuses a specified or implemented functionality from a super class, while delegation reuses implemented functionality in an existing object. \nDelegation is more flexible to use, inheritance is straightforward and easy to implement.\nInheritance has one disadvantage: if you change the signature of the superclass, all the subclasses have to be recompiled. On the other hand, a bad use of delegation might lead to high coupling\n\nExamples:\n- Inheritance: \"FoldableSmartphone\" and \"Smartphone\" the FoldableSmartphone extends the Smartphone with a hinge and the option to fold the screen. This should NOT be delegated because the FoldableSmartphone should have at least the same attributes as the Smartphone class.\n- Delegation: PhysicalCamera and CameraApp should be coupled by delegation. The CameraApp uses the \"take a photo\" functionallity of a PhysicalCamera to make the user's action of clicking a button actually take a photo, therefore it delegates this responsibility.",

I would choose it in order to save battery.\nAn additional big goal in smartphones is to keep memory free, cause usually they don't have big memory cards.

One can imagine inheritance as a family tree, where each class inherits aspects from their parent, but with additional attributes and functionalities. Delegation, as the name suggests is just as if your boss delegates a task to you.\n\nOne of the advantages of inheritance is that it is very easy to create variants of one main type (e.g. fast cars vs. slow cars). A disadvantage would be that the children always have to take over aspects from their parent, even though they might not need them.\n\nAn advantage of delegation is the added security layer, as the \"requestor\" only has direct access to a receiver and not to the class which executes the request. A disadvantage is that delegation is oftentimes more \"expensive\" in terms of computations, as there has to be a receiver as well as the executor.\n\nOne example of inheritance in smartphones are the apps. Every app on, e.g. iOS, has to fulfill certain requirements, which are the same, so that it can be used on an Apple device. The actual functionality is what makes each app (\"child\") unique.\n\nAn example of delegation in smartphones would be selecting a photo that you want to send via text. Here you only have the option of browsing through the photos (receiver) and selecting them, but you don't have direct access to the functionalities of the photo-app (executor).",

In this case it would be smart to use deligation rather than inheritance to get the needed funtionallity from the calender app because you just need a little part of the calender app's functionallity and do want not expose unwanted methods.\n\nSmartphone example, Inheritance:\nWhen using the settings app on your smartphone i would use inheritance to program each sub category of the settings. All the sub categories have very common features (A name, certain number of buttons...). So it is easy to let these sub categories inherit the attributes and methods from one superclass.\n",

      "text": "The difference between inheritance and delegation is that inheritance allows the programmer to extend a class and offer its ENTIRE functionality and if desired add something on top of that.\nDelegation is a method where the programmer creates a receiver that takes requests from a client and then delegates them to the delegate. The receiver might only offer parts of the functionality of the delegate.\n\nAdvantages:\nDelegation helps to ensure that a client cannot misuse some functionality of the delegate.\nInheritance is easy and fast to implement and supported in (almost) all Programming Languages.\n\nDisadvantages:\nInheritance might expose some functionality that we don't want the subclass to have. A malicious or unknowing user/caller might then abuse this class.\nWith delegation the receiver and the delegate needs to be instantiated. That leads to slight overhead.\n\nSmartphone Apps use inheritance. There would be an abstract app class and different Subclasses like System Apps, PlayStore Apps and 3rdParty Apps that share common functionality.\n\nSmartphones also use delegation. There is the normal user mode and the superuser mode. By default only normal mode can be accessed which redirects all the requests to the superuser.",
