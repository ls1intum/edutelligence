Visual Studio Code Setup
===========================================

To open the project in VS Code and still receive full intellisense, open the ``athena-workspace.code-workspace`` file in this repository in VS Code:

- Open VS Code
- Click ``File`` â†’ ``Open Workspace from File...``
- Select the ``athena-workspace.code-workspace`` file in this repository

This will open a workspace with all virtual environments pre-configured. Depending on the folder you are working in, the correct virtual environment will be automatically selected. You will also see the individual folders twice in the ``Explorer`` tab on the left, but you can ignore them.
