# Hyperion: AI-Driven Programming Exercise Creation Assistance

**Hyperion** is a microservice designed to bring AI-driven intelligence to Learning Management Systems (LMSs), such as [Artemis](https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis). Inspired by the Titan of light and enlightenment, Hyperion illuminates the process of creating engaging, effective programming exercises. It assists instructors by refining problem statements, generating code stubs, and providing context-aware suggestions â€” all while integrating seamlessly with an LMS and CI build agents for validation.
